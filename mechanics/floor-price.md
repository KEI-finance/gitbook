# ðŸ“ˆ Floor Price

Kei Finance's "Raising Floor Price" mechanism is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other DeFi protocols. When a user performs a buy or sell transaction, the mechanism checks the current price of the pool and the floor price. If the price of the pool is below the floor price, the mechanism automatically buys back assets from the pool to raise the floor price. The amount of assets to be bought back is calculated algorithmically, which aims to ensure that the price of the pool is consistently above the floor price. This process is fully automated and transparent, which is a way to promote stability in the value of the KEI token.
