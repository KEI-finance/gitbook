# ðŸ“ˆ Floor Price

The protocol token, is backed by a forever increasing floor price, creating security and safety that your token value will never go below a certain amount. This functionality is automatically on the blockchain, and whenever the price will go below, the protocol will instantly adjust the price to the correct floor price.&#x20;

Kei Finance's "Raising Floor Price" mechanism is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other DeFi protocols. When a user performs a buy or sell transaction, the mechanism checks the current price of the pool and the floor price. If the price of the pool is below the floor price, the mechanism automatically buys back assets from the pool to raise the floor price. The amount of assets to be bought back is calculated algorithmically, ensuring that the price of the pool is always above the floor price. This process is fully automated, transparent, and ensures that the value of Kei Finance tokens remains stable and sustainable.
