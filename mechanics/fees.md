# ðŸ’¸ Fees

The Kei Finance protocol implements a fee structure that aims to benefit all Kei Finance protocol participants. When buying or selling the KEI token, a fee is applied and serves as a secondary source of revenue for the protocol. The fee revenue is then reallocated back into the KEI reward system and distributed to the protocol's stakers, treasury, debt, affiliate, and admin channels.

Currently, the Kei Finance protocol's sell and buy fees are fixed at 3% for every transaction. We believe that this fee structure aligns with our mission of promoting the longevity of our platform's core infrastructure, while simultaneously rewarding our users with the collected fees received by the protocol.
