# ðŸ’¸ Fees

At Kei Finance, we strive to be transparent and create value for our users. To that end, we have implemented a fee structure that benefits everyone involved. When buying or selling our token, a fee, known as the 'spread', is applied, and this spread is a secondary source of revenue for our platform. We then reallocate these fees back into our reward system, which is distributed among various parties, including stakers, treasury, debt, affiliates and admin.

Currently, our sell and buy fees are fixed at 3% for every transaction made on our platform. We believe that this fee structure aligns with our mission of promoting the longevity of our platform's core infrastructure while rewarding our users with the collected fees received by the protocol.

By implementing a fee structure that benefits everyone involved, we hope to create a more sustainable and equitable ecosystem for our users. We remain committed to transparency and ensuring that our users receive the best possible experience while using our platform.
