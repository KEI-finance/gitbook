# 🤏 Spread

The token fee or the ‘Spread' is the fee that is taken out of a transaction when someone buys or sells a token. The ‘Spread’ is the secondary source of profit to the Kei Finance Protocol that is reallocated to the reward system; which is then distributed between the Stakers, the Affiliates, DAO and the Treasury Reward.

There is a fixed ‘sell fee’ of 3% on every sale that is carried out on the platform. Conversely, the ‘buy fee’ on Kei Finance is a little more flexible than the ‘sell fee’ as it is designed to start off at a certain number (say between 5 or 6%) with the option for users to reduce that number down to zero by holding or staking the token upon initiating a swap or a supplier contract - otherwise known as bonding - over a period of time. The longer users ‘lock’ these tokens, the lesser the ‘spread’ and the more they can reduce the fees down to zero - with the idea that users can remove the buy fee if they hold the tokens over a duration.

These staked tokens are essential to servicing the platform’s core infrastructure, and are set to incentivise users towards holding the Kei token for a period of time and also potentially stake it as well.
