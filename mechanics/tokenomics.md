# ðŸš€ Tokenomics

{% hint style="info" %}
Kei Finance stands out among DeFi protocols with its strategy of organic growth. Rather than minting the entire token supply upfront, Kei initiates with a **minimal supply** and **gradually increases** as traction gains, **mitigating immediate sell-off risks** and ensuring **sustained growth**.

The KEI token carries **intrinsic value** as its creation is never arbitrary but rather **treasury-backed**, distinguishing it from others. The protocol follows a cautious tactic, **only minting new tokens post-profit realization**, except in the case of liquidity pool operations. **Tokens are minted upon liquidity supply and burned upon removal,** safeguarding KEI's stability and shielding it from devaluation threats. This unique approach to tokenomics bolsters **long-term stability and value retention** in the KEI ecosystem.

## **KEI Tokenomics**

<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th width="126">Tokens</th><th width="174">Price Per Token</th><th>Lock-In Period</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Team</td><td>1 million</td><td>$0.03</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Private Round</td><td>3 million</td><td>$0.03</td><td>1+ years</td></tr><tr><td>Public Sale</td><td>32 million</td><td>$0.04</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Operational Activities (airdrops, rewards, team, etc)</td><td>4 million</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidity provision</td><td>10 million</td><td>0.042</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Funding Allocation**

Funding allocation is for liquidity provision, treasury, marketing campaigns, audit requirements, team expansion, and other relevant needs, bolstering the protocol's growth and performance. This allocation strategy is designed to ensure **minimal supply tokenomics**, **price stability**, and **organic growth**, encapsulating the unique principles of KEI Finance.

| Purpose                                         | Allocation                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Liquidity Pool (Set at $0.042/token)            | 10 million tokens + Raised Capital            |
| KEI Treasury                                    | $700,000 (Floor Price Stabilization at $0.02) |
| Team expansion                                  | -                                             |

## Token structure

The KEI token, the lifeblood of the Kei Finance ecosystem, operates as a reward mechanism and a stability safeguard. Progressive minting based on profitability ensures its organic growth and value. The sKEI token, a tangible representation of stake and governance in the Kei Protocol, allows holders to actively influence the system's future.&#x20;

Together, KEI and sKEI create an ecosystem that balances reward, stability, and democratic decision-making, embodying the best principles of DeFi.

### KEI token

The KEI token, integral to Kei Finance, operates as the primary reward engine driving the ecosystem's smart contracts. It is disbursed to proactive stakers on the platform, engaging them in the protocol's profit distribution. This mechanism cultivates fair profit-sharing, fostering community cohesion and collective responsibility, thus enriching the participatory experience in the Kei Finance ecosystem.

### sKEI token

The sKEI token, earned via KEI staking, serves a dual purpose: representing a genuine stake in the Kei Protocol and functioning as a governance token. Holding sKEI qualifies you to participate in voting, thereby influencing the Kei Protocol's trajectory. Essentially, sKEI holders are equipped with the agency to express their viewpoints and contribute to the decision-making process.

Where [**sKEI**](tokenomics.md#skei-token) represents the staking token for the protocol.

## Daily Allocation

he daily token allocation, supplied by the Supplier, propels Kei Finance's organic growth. Available for purchase solely via the website dashboard, it provides more competitive rates than Uniswap pool purchases. The allocation is fixed-price, promising stable pricing for users. It's important to note the daily allocation caps at <mark style="background-color:green;">33,333</mark> tokens and replenishes the following day (UTC+0 time). This fosters measured token distribution, enhancing fairness and transparency within the Kei Finance ecosystem.

## Deflationary Mechanics

Kei Finance employs deflationary mechanisms to enhance KEI token value sustainably. When the protocol generates profit, a portion is assigned to the treasury, initiating a corresponding token burn. This action decreases total token supply, elevating the token's base value and fostering long-term growth. This innovative strategy cultivates token scarcity and value appreciation, delivering benefits across all stakeholders within the Kei Finance ecosystem.

## Inflationary Mechanics

Kei Finance employs inflationary mechanisms via Staking rewards and Supplier allocations to incentivize long-term holding and foster steady growth. The protocol envisions maintaining equilibrium between an expanding token supply and the treasury value, liquidity pool, and staked amount. In contrast to many platforms minting their full token supply at inception, Kei Finance begins with the minimum and gradually expands. This approach ensures a more sustainable, equitable ecosystem, rewarding all participants over time.

## Liquidity Pool

The Kei Protocol's liquidity pool is a self-managing system that operates seamlessly without any human intervention. As the value of the treasury grows, the protocol automatically transfers a portion of these assets into the liquidity pool, expanding its size and boosting the overall stability of the token's price. This unique feature promotes a gradual, organic growth trajectory for the protocol over an extended period to facilitate a more sustainable approach.
