# ðŸš€ Tokenomics

{% hint style="info" %}
The Kei Finance protocol is distinguished by its organic growth strategy, which sets it apart from most protocols that mint the total supply upfront. Instead, Kei Finance mints only the minimum required to launch and gradually increases the supply as the protocol gains momentum. This approach ensures a stable, long-term growth trajectory, minimizing the risk of immediate selling pressure upon launch.
{% endhint %}

> The two tokens that specifically power the Kei protocol are [**KEI**](tokenomics.md#kei-token) and [**sKEI**](tokenomics.md#skei-token). Where [**sKEI**](tokenomics.md#skei-token) represents the staking token for the protocol.

| Title                                                        | Amount (KEI) |  Price (USD)  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -----------: | :-----------: |
| [Private Round](tokenomics.md#private-round)                 |    5,000,000 |     $0.03     |
| [Initial Liquidity Allocation](tokenomics.md#liquidity-pool) |    2,000,000 |     $0.03     |

## KEI token

The KEI token can be found at the following address `0xF75C7a59bCD9bd207C4Ab1BEB0b32EEd3B6392f3`

{% hint style="success" %}
A crucial aspect to bear in mind about the KEI token is its intrinsic value, as it is never minted out of thin air. In fact, every mint event is **always backed** by the treasury, setting it apart from other platforms. KEI adopts a conservative approach and will only mint new tokens once it has **generated profit**. The only exception to this rule pertains to the liquidity pool mechanics, which mints tokens upon supplying liquidity and burns them when removing liquidity. This ensures the overall stability of the KEI token and protects it against potential devaluation risks.

### Trading Fees

The protocol enforces a customizable trading fee on each buy and sell. This assists with the [inflationary](tokenomics.md#inflationary-mechanisms) and [deflationary mechanics](tokenomics.md#deflationary-mechanisms) of the KEI token and reward system.

| Type     | Amount |
| -------- | ------ |
| Buy Fee  | 3%     |
| Sell Fee | 3%     |

The primary act right now of the buy sell fee is to apply [deflationary](tokenomics.md#deflationary-mechanisms) pressure with 88% of the 3% being burnt, and 12% of the 3% going to the operating company.

### Rewards

The KEI token serves as the key reward mechanism for the entire Kei Finance protocol, fueling all smart contracts within the ecosystem. In addition, this token is distributed to users who actively stake on the platform, enabling them to participate in the profit allocation process. This unique mechanism ensures that profits are allocated fairly to all stakeholders, fostering a sense of community and shared responsibility among all participants of the Kei Finance Protocol.



## sKEI token

{% hint style="info" %}
The sKEI token is more than just a token received through staking KEI; it symbolizes a tangible stake in the Kei Protocol and functions as a governance token. This dual role means that holding sKEI tokens is a prerequisite for participating in the voting process and shaping the future of the Kei Protocol. In essence, sKEI tokens empower their holders to voice their opinions and take part in the decision-making process.

## Daily Allocation

The daily allocation, which is supplied by the Supplier, serves as the driving force behind the protocol's organic growth. Users can access this allocation only by purchasing directly through the website dashboard, which offers more competitive prices than buying through the Uniswap pool. The allocation is provided at a fixed price, enabling users to benefit from greater pricing stability. However, it is worth noting that the daily allocation has a maximum supply limit of 33,333 tokens. Once this limit is reached, it will not be reset until the following day based on UTC+0 time. This unique feature ensures a consistent and measured approach to token distribution, promoting greater fairness and transparency in the Kei Finance ecosystem.

## Deflationary Mechanics

The Kei Finance protocol leverages deflationary mechanics to sustainably increase the value of the KEI token. Whenever profit is generated within the protocol, a portion of it is allocated to the treasury, triggering a burn of the profit allocation in tokens. This process helps reduce the overall token supply, increasing the floor value of the token and driving its long-term growth. Through this innovative mechanism, the Kei Finance ecosystem is able to promote greater token scarcity and value appreciation, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders involved in the protocol.

## Inflationary Mechanics

The Kei Finance protocol implements inflationary mechanics through its Staking rewards and Supplier allocations, with the goal of incentivizing long-term holders and promoting stable growth. While more tokens are being minted over time, the aim is to maintain a sense of relativity between the growing token supply, treasury value, liquidity pool, and total amount staked. This approach fosters stable and organic growth in a unique way that sets Kei Finance apart from other platforms. Unlike other protocols that mint their entire token supply up front, Kei Finance initially mints only the minimum required amount, with the intent of gradually expanding from there. By doing so, the protocol is able to create a more sustainable and equitable ecosystem, which benefits all participants in the long run.

## Liquidity Pool

The Kei Protocol's liquidity pool is a self-managing system that operates seamlessly without any human intervention. As the value of the treasury grows, the protocol automatically transfers a portion of these assets into the liquidity pool, expanding its size and boosting the overall stability of the token's price. This unique feature promotes a gradual, organic growth trajectory for the protocol over an extended period to facilitate a more sustainable approach.

## Private Round

The private round of the Kei Finance protocol played a pivotal role in deploying the full suite of smart contracts and ensuring sufficient liquidity in the pool to kickstart organic growth. The initial allocation of the private round amounted to 5 million tokens, priced at 3 cents per token and subject to a minimum one-year lockup period. As the protocol evolves and more users buy into and participate in the ecosystem, the percentage of the initial allocation will gradually decrease, allowing for a more inclusive and democratic distribution of tokens. This dynamic approach ensures the protocol remains flexible and adaptive to changing market conditions while providing ample opportunity for new users to join the Kei Finance community.
