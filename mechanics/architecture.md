### The Architect Contract - An Overview&#x20;

The Architect contract is developed in a way that allows the company swap out contract components in the event of a required platform upgrade or internal platform issue.&#x20;

Built with multiple seperated contracts The Architect ensures each contract only is issued with the roles required to perfom its sole function. This is turn makes it easier to replace or upgrade an individual contract while maximising contract security.&#x20;

It has been built in such a way that future protocol development is enhanced as The Architect can be plugged directly into existing smart contract distribution systems.&#x20;

Whenever the protocol deploys a new profit generating product it will automatically be connected into the autonomous nature of the protocol.&#x20;
