# Profit Distribution

{% hint style="info" %}
Kei Protocol has a contract - known as rewards - that handles where each amount of profit generated on the platform is allocated. The platform rewards are the rewards that go through the reward contract and are then distributed to; Staking, Treasury, Debt Repayment, Liquidity and Affiliate reward programs.
{% endhint %}

KEI Finance ensures fair and sustainable profit distribution, aimed at aligning all stakeholders towards the common goal of the protocol's growth. Our robust [tokenomics](broken-reference) and unique profit distribution system benefit all participants, including stakers, the treasury, debt repayment mechanisms, and affiliates.

The individual allocations for each section are defined at each profit generating point. Meaning that different parts of the protocol will different the profit in different ways.

## Staking Rewards

Staking rewards make up a significant part of KEI's profit distribution. By staking KEI tokens, users receive Staked-KEI (sKEI) tokens, granting them governance rights and a portion of the protocol's rewards. The reward structure incentivises long-term and large-scale staking with greater rewards and voting power. Any penalties incurred by stakers prematurely unstaking are reallocated back into the staking reward pool, ensuring its continuous growth. Additionally, stakers receive a unique KEI NFT, immediately tradable on NFT marketplaces.

## Treasury Rewards

The KEI treasury rewards have a dual purpose of raising the floor price and implementing a deflationary mechanism. Minted tokens are returned to the treasury and burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. This strategy promotes price appreciation and fosters a sustainable ecosystem for KEI token holders.

## Debt Rewards

The KEI Protocol incorporates a debt concept wherein the platform can borrow funds from the treasury and redistribute these funds to other protocol sections, such as liquidity pools and borrowing. The reward allocation for the debt goes into paying of the debt balance. Providing a stable and consistent debt management practice. Once all debts are paid off, the debt rewards allocation is redirected to the treasury, bolstering the sustainability and enhancing the token's floor price.

## Processor Rewards

The rewards allocated to the processor in the protocol serve the purpose of reimbursing specific tasks on the platform. These rewards are specifically intended to cover gas costs and other related expenses, ensuring that the processing actions within the protocol remain affordable and removing any associated costs for users. This approach enhances user experience by eliminating the burden of transaction fees and making platform interactions more cost-effective.

## Affiliate Rewards

KEI Finance rewards its community members for expanding its user base through a multi-tiered affiliate program. It represents a smaller but substantial portion of the overall reward pool. If a user (A) refers a new user (B) who makes a purchase, the referrer (A) earns 90% of the profit allocated to the affiliate reward. This reward system extends one more level, with the referrer earning 10% for purchases made by individuals referred by their invitees.

The KEI Finance affiliate program encourages active community involvement and strengthens the network effect, thus contributing to the platform's overall growth and prosperity. The rewards are only distributed when the invitee executes a trade on the platform, ensuring a genuine expansion of the user base.  Learn more on affiliate rewards in the [identity](../product-and-offerings/affiliate/) section.

## Admin Distribution:

A small percentage determined by the number of platform users and volume is distributed to an admin pool that is used by the company to continue service execution.&#x20;



Our profit distribution system, through these four interconnected mechanisms, establishes a positive feedback loop, fostering platform sustainability, token value growth, and community involvement.
