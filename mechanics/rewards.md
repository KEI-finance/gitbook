# ðŸª™ Rewards

{% hint style="info" %}
Kei Protocol has a contract - known as rewards - that handles where each amount of profit generated on the platform is allocated. The Platform rewards are basically the rewards that go through the reward contract and are then distributed to; Staking, Treasury, Affiliates, Debt Repayment and affiliate reward programs.

## Staking Rewards

A percentage of the rewards distribution goes to stakers. This is the standard stakers reward. The Staker reward is calculated regarding a userâ€™s return on investment when staking. To earn on Kei, users are required to stake on the Kei pool to earn the staked-Kei (sKEI) token, which is also the governance token. This token allows users to vote on improvements to Kei. To stake, users need to set their stake timeframe; such that, the larger the stake amount the more rewards and voting power, and the longer the stake duration the more rewards and voting power.

Every wallet that claims the KEI token is qualified to receive the Kei NFT. These collectibles are immediately tradable on Opensea as NFTs.

The staking reward pool is ever-increasing; such that revenue generated from penalties charged on stakers who defaulted is reallocated into the staking reward pool.

## &#x20;Treasury Rewards

A portion of the platformâ€™s rewards are allocated to the DAO treasury that constantly lends the native KEI token to the different sections of protocol such as the lending and the liquidity pools.

The treasury rewards are allocated to the treasury, such that, as more of these rewards gets accumulated in the treasury reserve, the floor price of the token increases in concert, since the treasury will always have more funds to buy back the KEI tokens.

Through this mechanism, the treasury rewards will tend to grow the floor price of the token in the long run.

## Debt Rewards

Kei Protocol has a concept of debt; where the platform can borrow funds from the treasury and redistribute these funds to any sections of the protocol that is in want.

A good example of this is the liquidity pools; where funds are moved from the treasury into the liquidity pool to support sufficient trades.

As such, these redistributed funds from the treasury are recorded as debts, where the platform perpetually offsets these loans through the debt reward distribution until there are no more debts to be paid.

Upon offsetting all of the debts accrued by borrowing funds from the treasury to service other sections of the protocol, all debts rewards distribution allocated for the repayment of the platformâ€™s debts will go directly to the treasury, to further boost the platformâ€™s reserve. &#x20;

At its core, the debt reward pays back to a treasury which increases the floor price of the token.

## Affiliate Rewards

The Affiliate reward is a part of the profit distribution representing a much smaller percentage of the overall reward pool. Users of Kei Protocol can join the referral program to earn more in rewards.

How the affiliate/referral reward program works is; should person A refer person B to the platform and person B make any purchases, then person A would earn a portion of 80% of the profit that is allocated to the affiliate reward. In simple terms, the reward distribution for affiliate rewards is such that the rewards go from the platformâ€™s profit to the affiliate reward to person A rewards.

Kei Protocol allows for a multi-level affiliate system where an affiliate - person B - can refer another affiliate - person C - such that if person C makes a purchase, then person A will receive 10% of the profit allocated to the affiliate reward from the enter platformâ€™s profit. The Kei Protocol affiliate program is a multi-tiered reward system that spans three levels - with the first tier, the referrer earns a reward of 80% in profit, and in the other two sub-levels, the second-person referrer earns 10% respectively.

Affiliate rewards are only awarded to referrers for their invitees who makes an actual trade on the platform.
