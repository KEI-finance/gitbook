* What is Affiliate reward?

Users of Kei Protocol can join the affiliate program to earn more in rewards, by referring new users to the platform as an extra way to earn more.

On the first tier, the referrer earns a reward of 80% in profit, and in the other two sub-levels, the referrer - who then defaults to a second-person referrer - earns 10% respectively.

The Kei Protocol referral program is structured such that it spans three levels. The referral program is such that; should person A refer person B to the platform and person B make any purchases, then person A would earn a portion of 80% of the profit that is allocated to the affiliate reward. And should person B refer person C, Person A earns an extra 10% off the affiliate reward given person’s C’s transaction, and an extra 10% should person C invites person D.
