# FAQ

**1. What does staking mean on Kei Finance?** Staking on Kei Finance is an investment strategy where users lock up their Kei tokens to earn high yields and long-term rewards. The principle is straightforward: the longer you stake your tokens, the higher the rewards you earn.

**2. Can you explain the Kei Protocolâ€™s Governance tokens?** The governance token in the Kei ecosystem is also known as Staked-Kei. This is the token that users receive when they stake their assets on the platform. It represents your stake and influences your voting power in the system's governance.

**3. What is a staker's reward in the Kei ecosystem?** A staker's reward is the return on investment a user earns from staking. Kei Protocol's staking reward pool is designed to increase over time. Revenue generated from penalties charged on stakers who default on their staking commitment is reallocated into the staking pool, ensuring an ever-growing reward structure.

**4. Could you elaborate on the Treasury reward?** The treasury reward is a portion of the platform's earnings allocated to the treasury. These funds are periodically used to buy back Kei tokens, a mechanism designed to increase the token's floor price, thereby providing stability and rewarding long-term holders.

**5. What is the Affiliate reward?** The Affiliate reward is an additional earning opportunity provided by Kei Protocol. Users can join the affiliate program and earn extra rewards by referring new users to the platform. The structure spans three levels: the referrer earns 80% in profit on the first tier and 10% each on the next two tiers for their referrals' purchases.

**6. How does unstaking work in the Kei Protocol?** Users can unstake their tokens after the staking period ends. However, unstaking before the end of the staking period incurs a penalty proportional to the remaining duration. This mechanism is designed to promote stability in the token supply and maintain the token's utility.

**7. What happens to the penalties incurred from early unstaking?** Penalties incurred from early unstaking are reallocated. A percentage goes back to the staking pool to increase the rewards for committed stakers, while a portion is sent to the treasury to support buybacks and maintain the token's floor price.

**8. How secure is my investment in Kei Finance?** At Kei Finance, we prioritize the security of our users' investments. Our smart contracts are audited and open for public scrutiny, ensuring transparency and trust. Additionally, our innovative token supply mechanism and hard floor price provide an added layer of security for token holders.

**10.
