# Terms and Conditions

Kei Finance is a decentralised finance (DeFi) application that interacts with the Ethereum network and Arbitrum nework, accessed via a specially developed smart contract (“Smart Contract”) to enable users to access a swapping & bonding protocol, staking and lending functions, tooling and treasury management services (“Services). The protocol and its Services can be accessed on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”). The swapping & bonding protocol, staking and lending functions and treasury management services, Smart Contract and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App.” Using the App, users can interact with existing smart contracts on the Ethereum network in order to access the Services. Our App enables users to access DeFi Services that may be further developed by us in the future.\

## THE APP

To use the App most easily, you may first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser) and an electronic wallet compatible with the erc-20 Token standard and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard on the Ethereum network, such as the MetaMask electronic wallet. MetaMask wallet and other electronic wallets allow you to purchase (either directly, or via other third-party sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask wallet, or other Ethereum-compatible browsers and wallets as confirmed on our website and official social media platforms.

&#x20;Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain and/or any other blockchain supported in the future. You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.

&#x20;We neither own nor control Metamask, any centralised or decentralised exchanges, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third-party site, blockchain, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that we will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

&#x20;You must connect your wallet in order to interact with and use the App. By connecting your wallet, you warrant, covenant, and agree that you are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (or any other electronic wallets and accounts). Kei Finance will never intentionally gain access to or store any private wallet keys. If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your wallet through our App or Site, you agree to notify us immediately at support@kei.fi.

### &#x20;Feedback

&#x20;You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas, or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third-parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide licence under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, shareholders, employees, team members, contractors, and licensors will not be liable to you or to any third-party for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages which you may incur, howsoever caused and under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, any loss of profits (whether incurred directly or indirectly), loss of goodwill or business reputation, loss of data, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or any other intangible loss, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. You further covenant and agree that you release Kei Finance, our subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, shareholders, employees, team members, contractors, and licensors from any liability, damages, claim, or losses that may arise in accordance with this clause 7.1.

You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that our total, aggregate liability to you for any and all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or your access to or use of (or your inability to access or use) any portion of the App whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or any other legal theory, is limited to the greater of:

The amounts you actually paid us under these terms in the 12-month period preceding the date the claim arose; or

7.2.2.$100.

You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that we have made the App available to you and entered into these terms in reliance upon the warranties, disclaimers, and limitations of liability set forth herein, which reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between the parties and form an essential basis of the bargain between us. You further acknowledge, covenant, and agree that we would not be able to provide the App to you without these limitations.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, and some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so the above limitations may not apply to personal injury claims.

You hereby acknowledge, covenant, and agree that you release in perpetuity Kei Finance, its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, shareholders, employees, team members, contractors, and licensors from any and all losses, claims, damages, and liability that may arise from the use of our App apart as it is set out in these Terms and Conditions of Use.

## **ASSUMPTION OF RISK**

You acknowledge, covenant, and agree as follows:

&#x20;The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Kei Finance Tokens and NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchases made via our App will not lose money.

&#x20;You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Kei Finance Token and NFT transactions related to our App. Kei Finance is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or any Smart Contract.

&#x20;The App does not store, send, or receive Tokens or NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain. Any transfer of NFT occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on the actual App.

&#x20;There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorised access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Kei Finance will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using any supported blockchain, however caused.

&#x20;A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Kei Finance ecosystem, and therefore the potential commercial viability, utility or value of our App and Kei Finance Tokens and NFTs.

&#x20;The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Kei Finance ecosystem, and therefore the potential commercial viability, utility or value of our App and Kei Finance Tokens and NFTs.

&#x20;Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, including the Kei Finance ecosystem.

## &#x20;**INDEMNIFICATION**

You covenant and agree to indemnify and hold harmless and indemnified Kei Finance and its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, shareholders officers, agents, employees, team members, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and legal  fees arising out of or in any way related to:

1. your breach of these Terms,
2. your misuse of the App, or
3. your violation of applicable laws, rules, or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App.

You agree that Kei Finance will have control of the defence or settlement of any such claims.

## **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms and Conditions. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms and Conditions create any agency, partnership, or joint venture.

The language in these Terms and Conditions will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party.

&#x20;You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.

Should any term or provision of these Terms and Conditions be held void, voidable, invalid, or unenforceable, then that term or provision shall be treated as changed or reduced, only to the extent minimally necessary to bring it within the laws of that jurisdiction and to prevent it from being void, it shall be binding in that changed or reduced form. Subject to this Clause, each provision and term shall be interpreted as severable and shall not in any way affect any other term and condition. The remaining Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect.

&#x20;In the event of any conflict between any provision of these Terms and Conditions and the provisions of the constitution of a limited company or any comparable document intended to regulate any other corporate or collective body, then the provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall prevail.

&#x20;Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms and Conditions will not be deemed a waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision at a later time.

The validity, construction, and performance of these Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Panama applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles.

&#x20;Subject to Clause 15, any legal action or proceedings arising under these Terms and Conditions will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the Republic of Panama and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there.

We will not be liable for any failure or delayed performance of our obligations that result from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood, acts of God, labour conditions, power failures, Internet disturbances, or acts or omissions of third parties.

You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that we may provide you with notices (including, without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions) by email, or postings on the App, our Website, or our social media platforms. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.
