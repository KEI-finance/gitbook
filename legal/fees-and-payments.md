# Fees and payments

Any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network and/or any other blockchain that may be supported in the future. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, you covenant and agree that we will have no liability to you or to any third-party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or any other supported blockchain.

Ethereum (as most layer 1 blockchains) requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralised Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.

&#x20;The swap function of the App conducts swaps through the relevant Uniswap liquidity pools and consequently swaps require the payment of the Uniswap liquidity pool fee (“Uniswap Fee”) in addition to the Gas Fee.

In addition to the Gas Fee and the Uniswap Fee, each time you use our App to conduct a token swap, you authorise and direct us to collect a variable fee of the total value of that transaction (each, a “transaction fee”). You acknowledge and agree that the transaction fee will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment. We will not collect transaction fees for interactions that do not involve our token.

&#x20;As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, sale, or disposal of any of your Kei Finance Tokens and NFTs via the App).

Except for income taxes levied on Kei Finance, you covenant and agree that you:

1. will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter maybe imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other tax jurisdiction; and
2. shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. You confirm that you are not a resident of the Republic of Panama and/or the Commonwealth of Australia nor are you registered for Goods and Services Tax / Value Added tax (GST / VAT) and will inform Kei Finance if your status changes in the future.
