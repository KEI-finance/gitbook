# KEI Token & NFTs

We have utilised Smart Contracts to develop our KEI Token (KEI & sKEI) and KEI NFT. Every wallet that claims the KEI token is qualified to receive the Kei NFT. These collectibles are immediately tradable on Opensea as NFTs, and eventually our own marketplace.

The purpose of KEI Tokens is to allow holders to interact with the app, stake them in the protocol and accrue more collective value by way of Annual Percentage Yields (APYs). We do not make any representations as to the future value, potential profitability, or financial/commercial nature of the KEI Finance NFTs and upon accepting these terms and conditions and participating in the minting of KEI Finance NFTs, you acknowledge, covenant, and agree that no such representations have been made by KEI Finance.

Four reward distributions reallocate profits to users in multiple tiers on KEI Protocol in accordance with the protocol documents. This includes the Stakers’ rewards, Treasury rewards, Debt Reward and Affiliate rewards.

Through these reward programs, the platform maintains a system that reallocates revenue, such as those generated from penalties and fees on the platform, back to the reward pool and trickles down to stakeholders on the platform; such as Stakers whose funds power the liquidity pool.

“Art” means any art, design, and drawings that may be associated with the KEI Finance NFT that you own.

“Extensions” means third party designs that:

1. 3.1.1.are intended for use as extensions or overlays to the Art;

## Licence to Art

### &#x20;General Use

Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms and Conditions, KEI Finance grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes:

1. for your own personal, non-commercial use;
2. as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased KEI Finance NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each KEI Finance NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased KEI Finance NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or
3. as part of a third-party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased KEI Finance NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each KEI Finance NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased KEI Finance NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased KEI Finance NFT leaves the website/application.

### &#x20;Commercial use

Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms and Conditions, KEI Finance  grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT for the purpose of commercialising your own merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does not result in you earning more than One Hundred Thousand US Dollars ($100,000) in gross revenue each year. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Clause will be deemed to restrict you from:

1. owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of KEI Finance NFTs generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each KEI Finance NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased KEI Finance NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art;
2. owning or operating a third-party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of KEI Finance NFTs generally, provided that the third-party website or application cryptographically verifies each KEI Finance NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased KEI Finance NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased KEI Finance NFT leaves the website/application; or
3. earning revenue from any of the aforementioned actions, even where such revenue is in excess of $100,000 per year.

&#x20;

In the event that your gross annual revenue from the Commercial Use of the Art of your Purchased KEI Finance NFT exceeds the sum of $100,000, KEI Finance reserves its right to seek royalty payments at the rate of 10% of the gross annual revenue earned over and above the sum of $100,000. You warrant, covenant, and agree that upon KEI Finance’s request, you shall provide accurate particulars and information in relation to the revenue derived from the said Commercial Use and you shall pay to KEI Finance within thirty (30) days from the date of a request for payment the amount that is equivalent to 10% of your gross annual revenue exceeding the sum of $100,000.

### &#x20;Ownership

You Own the NFT. Each KEI Finance NFT is a non-fungible token (an “NFT”) on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase a KEI Finance NFT, you own the underlying NFT completely. This means that you have the right to trade your NFT, sell it, or give it away subject to the commission provision set out in Clause 4.3 below. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point will we be able to seize or otherwise modify the ownership of any KEI Finance NFT.

&#x20;In the event of a breach of these Terms and Conditions, KEI Finance may with or without prior notice restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Website, and App and such restriction, suspension, or termination shall not be deemed inconsistent with the proprietary rights granted in this Clause 3.3.

KEI Finance owns the App. You acknowledge and agree that KEI Finance  (or, as applicable, our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein (including without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel”, organisation, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the “KEI Finance  Materials”)).

You acknowledge, covenant, and agree that the KEI Finance Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws.

For the sake of clarity, you acknowledge, covenant, and agree that:

1. your purchase of a KEI Finance NFT, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licences in or to the KEI Finance Materials (including without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms;
2. you do not have the right, except as otherwise set out in these Terms and Conditions, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialise any elements of the KEI Finance Materials (including without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion;
3. you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any KEI Finance trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion;
4. you will not copy or use any code or part of our smart contracts without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion; and
5. KEI Finance is entitled to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the App and the KEI Finance software suite and services in accordance with the terms of Clause 3.3.2 above.

1. modify the Art for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or colour schemes (your use of Extensions will not constitute a prohibited modification hereunder);
2. use the Art for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT to advertise, market, or sell any third-party product or service;
3. use the Art for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others;

7. otherwise utilise the Art, code, or software for your Purchased KEI Finance NFT or the App for your or any third party’s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased KEI Finance NFT contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows:
   1. that you will not have the right to use such Third-Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the licence and restrictions contained herein;
   2. that the Commercial Use licence in Clause 3.2.2 above will not apply;
   3. that, depending on the nature of the licence granted from the owner of the Third-Party IP, KEI Finance may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and
   4. to the extent that KEI Finance informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permitted), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this licence. The restrictions in this Clause will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.

&#x20;

### Other Terms and Conditions of License

If you exceed the scope of the licence grant in Clause 3.2.2 without either paying the royalty fee, or entering into a broader licence agreement with, or obtaining an exemption from Kei Finance, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. you are in breach of these Terms;
2. in addition to any remedies that may be available to Kei Finance at law or in equity Kei Finance may immediately terminate your access to the Kei Finance  App, and the licence that was granted to you in Section 3.2, without the requirement of notice; and
