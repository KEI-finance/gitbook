# Protocol Growth & Intrinsic Value

KEI finance was conceptualised after experiencing industry wide downfalls within the decentralised finance industry. After extensive research and review of traditional decntralised finance projects KEI has birthed its own bespoke tokenomic systems that align with the protocol's distribution methods - built to sustain long term growth with organic user growth.&#x20;

## **Minimum Token Supply At Launch**&#x20;

Traditionally DeFi platforms will mint their full supply on launch and keep a set quantity off the market and slowly release those tokens into the market at regular intervals. Understanding the basic laws of supply and demand, the more tokens that enter circulation must be aligned with the demand for that token. If not, the token risks high devaluation upon release of more supply.&#x20;

KEI finance has designed an organic token & platform aligned growth strategy. KEI finance will launch with a minimum supply of tokens only, meaning that tokens minted on day 1 are the minimum amount needed to run the platform.&#x20;

As the platform onboards new users KEI finance's of self-regulating smart contracts known as the processor and the supplier can balance the token supply by either minting new KEI tokens or. burning existing tokens ensuring that the demand for the token is always greater than the supply. This ensures that the token is never unnecessarily inflated.&#x20;

## **KEI tokens backed by real asset value.**&#x20;

At the core of KEI Finance's value proposition is the KEI token's intrinsic value. Unlike other tokens that may be created arbitrarily, each KEI token is treasury-backed. The protocol adopts a prudent strategy where new tokens are minted only after profit realization, with the only exception being in the case of liquidity pool operations.

The safeguarding of KEI's intrinsic value is further reinforced by the protocol's unique approach to liquidity pool operations. Specifically, tokens are minted upon the supply of liquidity and burned upon its removal. This process plays a pivotal role in preserving KEI's stability, acting as a bulwark against potential devaluation threats and market volatility.

The amalgamation of an organic growth strategy and a relentless focus on maintaining intrinsic token value yields a robust tokenomics framework. This framework, coupled with a sustainable ecosystem architecture, underscores KEI finance's commitment to long-term stability, value retention, and the enduring success of the KEI ecosystem.

## **Innovative Supply Mechanism: Beyond Bonding**

In the traditional DeFi landscape, bonding is a common mechanism for managing token supply. Bonding refers to the process whereby a user locks their tokens for a certain duration in exchange for rewards. This mechanism, while effective, has certain drawbacks, such as the inflexibility of locked durations and potential market volatility during the lock-in period.

KEI Finance innovates beyond this standard through an improved token supply mechanism that circumvents the need for bonding and the associated lock-in periods. This is an essential upgrade as it introduces liquidity on demand, an aspect often lacking with traditional bonding mechanisms.

Our new supply mechanism integrates directly into the buying logic, eliminating the need for users to lock away their assets for fixed periods to gain returns. This flexibility allows users to maintain liquidity while still profiting from their token holdings.

Moreover, this mechanism also reinforces KEI's price stability. With a traditional bonding system, market prices could potentially be impacted when a large number of bonded tokens become unlocked and flood the market. By eliminating the need for bonding, Kei's supply mechanism mitigates this risk, contributing to a more stable and predictable token value.

The beyond bonding innovation thus enhances both liquidity and stability, paving the way for an optimized user experience and a more resilient KEI ecosystem.

## Controlled Minting: Linking Profits and Prices

KEI Finance's token minting process is intrinsically tied to profit generation and the moving floor price. This unique approach ensures a reduction in token minting as the KEI price ascends, fostering a controlled yet positive price trajectory that mitigates the risk of inflation and preserves the token's purchasing power.

## Crypto-Native Reserve Currency Functionality

Through the integration of these innovative features, KEI finance is paving the way for KEI to serve as a crypto-native reserve currency. Positioned to fill the void between stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies and highly volatile crypto assets, KEI is engineered to offer deep liquidity, function as a reliable unit of account, and protect purchasing power. With a strong commitment to effective treasury management, transparent on-chain governance structures, and strategic use of liquidity and treasury assets, KEI finance is setting the stage for sustained stability, growth, and value preservation within the KEI ecosystem.
