#### Access Opportunity Mechanics & Structure

Our unique pricing model is designed to confer significant advantages to early participants, with lasting benefits extended to those who join us at later stages. We have meticulously designed a post-Token Generation Event (TGE) release plan, with a thoughtful unlocking and vesting schedule to support sustainable platform growth.

The presale offering will consist of seven price levels, ranging from $0.10 per token down to $0.07 per token (a 42.8% discount). The sooner you join, the more advantageous the terms.

Here's the highlight: even at the top-tier pricing of $0.10 per token, we've deliberately set a modest platform valuation for Kei Finance. This reflects our unwavering commitment to platform sustainability and long-term value creation, rather than short-term financial outcomes.

#### Access Opportunity Overview

The KEI presale commences on the <mark style="background-color:blue;">29th of August 2023,</mark> via our website. This offering will feature 7 price levels, from $0.10 per token down to $0.07 with a 58.8% discount. The a maximum allocation of tokens is set to 1,000,000. Our goal is to circulate 58.33% of the initial total token supply to raise $3.12 million, setting a modest platform valuation of $6 million FDV.

The Token Generation Event (TGE) will have a date locked in towards the end of the year feature a price of $0.12 per token, with 15% of the initial total token supply allocated to the initial liquidity pool.

#### Access Opportunity Stages

Interested parties will be able to participate using FIAT, USDC or ETH.

The offering stages are devised to incentivize early participation, with fewer tokens allocated at the lowest price level. For instance, at $0.07, there will be 3% of tokens on offer, increasing to 13.3% of tokens at $0.10.

It's crucial to emphasize that even the TGE price of $0.12 represents compelling value, thanks to our modest platform valuation. This sets the stage for a healthy, positive price discovery process upon TGE.

#### Token Distribution & Interaction Opportunities

At TGE, 15% of tokens will be immediately available, with the remainder divided into four staking positions locked for intervals of 30 days. This system creates a graduated vesting distribution spanning four months, thereby facilitating meaningful engagement with our platform during the vesting period.
