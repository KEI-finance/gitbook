### Security On KEI finance | Keeping Your Funds Secure

Access via email or social methods are powered by a new form of technology called Account Abstraction (ERC-4337 Standard) which basically means that a digital wallet is solely secured by a smart contract and not an externally operated wallet. Account Abstraction powers web3 technology to use a multi-signature technology just like Web2 methods. KEI finance implements two-factor authentication (2FA) code systems to add an additional layer of security for users.&#x20;



During pivotal moments within a user journey, KEI finance will send out 2FA codes to users via their selected methods (Email verification, Authenticator Apps). Using 2FA users maintain the final confirmation from a user owned third party software.&#x20;
