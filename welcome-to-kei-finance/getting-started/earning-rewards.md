Upon purchasing the KEI token - by swapping assets (like Ethereum) for KEI - holders become eligible to participate in the KEI Protocol liquidity pool - where they take their KEI tokens and then they stake them.

Although, there is an option to stake your KEI tokens upon initiating a ‘Buy order,’ users who skipped that step can re-initiate the process anytime as Staking on KEI Protocol can be done in three simple steps. Follow the step-by-step tutorial below to learn how to do so.

* On PC, click on ‘Stake’ on the left-hand sidebar and input the amount of Kei tokens you would like to trade for some staked-Kei, in addition to the stake duration, and tap ‘Confirm Stake’.
