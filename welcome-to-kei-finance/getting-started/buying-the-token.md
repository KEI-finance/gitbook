# Buying

Once users have successfully connected their wallets they can immediately engage in the buying process. To purchase KEI tokens users can swap via a range of tokens cross-chain or purchase directly from fiat via a bank card.&#x20;

KEI finance is committed to offering the most user friendly and familiar access options to the protocol. As a commitment to DeFi simplified, users are able to choose which method suits their personal needs.&#x20;

Once a user has purchased KEI tokens they will have the option to stake their tokens. Staking is like interest but within the world of web3. Stake tokens are locked in smart contracts which are like vaults. Tokens within the contract earn an APR (Interest Rate) on their tokens which can be accessed daily.&#x20;

### Presale Purchases

Users who opted for a 42% discount via the presale will receive placeholder KEI tokens that represent the value owed on TGE (Token Generation Event) When the KEI token is launched on the 8th of February investors will automatically receive their portion of KEI tokens.&#x20;
