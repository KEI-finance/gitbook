# KEI Staking

{% hint style="info" %}
The staking platform on KEI Finance transcends the mere role of offering rewards to investors in the protocol. It also stands as the principal interface for engaging with the protocol. Coupled with reward multipliers, it amplifies your user experience and return on investment, making it more than just a passive investment platform.

## **The Core Function: Long-Term Capital Growth**

By Staking into KEI finance users are participating in the overall growth and long term sustainabiltiy of the KEI ecosystem. Staking takes tokens off the market reducing the available supply at any one time. This has a direct effect on supply and demand as less tokens are available when demand increases. Staking allows a user much like interest within banks to earn a rate of return on their locked tokens, known as APR.&#x20;

APR can be multiplied depending on the length of time a user chooses to stake and lock their tokens for. The overarching philosophy of KEI staking is straightforward - the longer the stake, the higher the rewards.

## **Reward Redistribution: Recirculating Value**

A percentage of all rewards generated by the platform's operations are redistributed directly to stakers. This continuous reallocation of earnings not only amplifies staker returns but also promotes long-term commitment to the protocol.

## **Staked-KEI Tokens: The Staking Commitment**

Users stake their KEI tokens for a predefined duration to earn staked-KEI tokens (sKEI). These tokens represent a user's stake position and commitment to the protocol. Unstaking KEI before the end of the predetermined staking period will invoke a penalty, reinforcing the principle of responsible staking.

sKEI are liquid tokens which represent the value of the users stake and can be used across the protocol. Think about liquid staking tokens as tickets at a themepark. They only hold value within the themepark and cannot be used elsewhere. They represent a monetary value paid on entry. sKEI tokens are usable on other financial tools on KEI effectively giving a deeper value and freeing up locked value in staking contracts.&#x20;

### Reward Multiplier: Increasing ROI

The longer you keep your money staked, the more rewards you can get. These extra rewards apply across all parts of the KEI Protocol, helping you earn more from every tool and service. For example, if you have a 10x reward multiplier, you could get about 10 times more rewards than someone with a 1x multiplier.

## **Penalty Structure: Discouraging Early Unstaking**

The penalty incurred for early unstaking is calculated based on the fraction of the committed staking period completed. The longer the staking duration and the earlier the unstaking, the higher the penalty imposed. This model encourages users to fully honor their staking commitments to maximize their rewards.

This deterrent discourages impulsive entry and exit from the staking pool, fostering a more stable and dependable staking environment.

> **Unstaking Penalty Example:** _A user staking their KEI tokens for a year who decides to unstake within the first 10 days could incur a penalty as high as 99% of the stake. In contrast, a user opting to unstake on the 340th day could incur a significantly lower penalty, reflecting the completed duration of their staking commitment._

## **Penalties and Principal: A Responsible Balance**

Initially, the penalties are applied to the staking profits. However, premature unstaking could result in penalties being deducted from the staked principal. The precise impact depends on how early a user decides to unstake.

## **Position Trading: Offering Flexibility**

Recognizing the need for flexibility, KEI Finance allows stakers to wholly or partially fragment (split) their staking positions and sell the value to a new or existing user. Doing so would bypass the unstake fee and pass the ownership of the staked value to buyer.&#x20;

Example: I have 1000 USD staked in KEI finance. I want to unstake 400 USD but do not want to pay an unstake penalty. I then split the 400 USD from the 1000 staked USD and list the 400USD as an NFT on a third party marketplace. (The process of creating NFTs is automated by the KEI finacne platform and does not require a heavy lift from the end user experience.)&#x20;

## Auto-Compounding x Reward Multiplier: Maximising ROI

The staking algorithm utilized by the KEI Protocol is pioneering in its integration of both auto-compounding and reward multiplier mechanics within a single staking pool. This unique structure endows users with the assurance of long-term staking without the risk of stake dilution as new participants enter the pool. Simultaneously, it empowers users to accrue higher rewards, even with a lower stake commitment, thereby optimizing their investment potential.

Auto Compouding Example: I stake 100 USD with a 10% APR (Rate of return) When I receive the 10% of 100 USD I now have 110 USD in value. The next 10% return is calculated from the new value of 110 USD generating 11 USD as opposed to the initial 10 USD on 100.&#x20;

## **Post-Duration Rewards: No Penalties, Continuous Earnings**

Once the committed staking duration is over, stakers continue earning rewards on their staked KEI tokens until they decide to unstake. At this stage, unstaking can be executed at any time without incurring any penalties, rewarding stakers for their completed commitment.
