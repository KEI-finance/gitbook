KEI finance Debit Cards are crypto's answer to digital asset payments. Using KEI finance Debit Cards , users can pay in store using the value of their crypto portfolio's that has previously been locked in on the blockchain. User funds remain on the blockchain, maintaining user custody of assets, always. Using the payment system, users execute a payment in store and the value is sold off from their portfolio or wallet and converted to fiat to secure the transaction.&#x20;

### How The KEI Debit Cards Work (User Focus)&#x20;

KEI Debit Cards Come in 3 types. Plastic, Metal and Non KYC Virtual (Available from Q1 2024). Users can will have access to plastic cards via a monthly subscription model or metal for those who are staking above $5000 USD on the KEI platform. Users can select their card of choice and upon verifying via KYC (Know Your Client) have the card sent to their desired address. \


Once a user has received the card they can then activate and connect the card via the KEI finance user dashboard. KEI debit cards are connected directly to Web3 digital wallets or live trading positions.&#x20;

Once the card is connected a user can execute in real life payments as they would with any normal Masatercard. This means in store purchases, subscriptions, online payments or cash withdrawals.&#x20;

The payment process is automated meaning that funds are only moved at the point of sale and remain in user control on the blockchain at all times.&#x20;

### Card Delivery & Purchase&#x20;

Cards can be pre purchased via [https://kei.fi/cards](https://kei.fi/cards) until launch (February 8th 2024) offering exclusive benefits for early holders including access to a private testing round.&#x20;

Users who opt to wait until the launch in 2024 can access KEI Debit Cards via the dApp. Upon purchase a user will be required to enter in their shipping details to have the card sent from Europe to their desired address. Pre purchase cards have no shipping fee, however those buying after launch will be required to pay for the postage. \


Once a card has been delivered a user can then connect their card to the KEI dashboard and begin the card setup process.&#x20;

### Setting Spending Limits&#x20;

In order to protect your funds from malicious attacks, users are advised to set their spending limits on the cards. Users can customise and change the amount at anytime. Spending limits operate in three forms where a user can protect against daily spending limits, weekly and monthly limits as well.&#x20;

### Connecting your KEI card&#x20;

Connecting a KEI card to your crypto wallet or to your live trading positions is much like connecting a wallet to a decentralised platform. You will need to approve the smart contract having access to your funds in order to execute the sale at point of purchase. Users can connect one wallet or trading positions for $5 per month of $50 upfront annual payment. If a user requires more connections KEI offers 5 connections for $20 per month or $200 upfront payment for 12 months.&#x20;

Note: The smart contract is only permitted to spend the limit set by the user and cannot access any more value than is limited by the user.&#x20;

### KYC (Know Your Client)&#x20;

KYC is a form of identity verification required by Mastercard to print and send physical cards to holders. In order to use a plastic or metal card, a user will have to complete the KYC form via the KEI finance website. KYC can be completed by uploading approved documents such as licenses, resident cards or passports along with proof of address.&#x20;

Note: Non-KYC virtual cards are currently in the works at KEI finance and aim to be released in the first quarter of next year. Non KYC cards will provide am ore manual experience where a user must top up the value on the card and pay from a pre paid value flow as opposed to direct from the blockchain.&#x20;

### KEI Debit Cards Payment Flows (Tech Focus)

KEI Debit Cards are directly connected to the Blockchain in a crypto payment first. This means that user funds are never managed by a 3rd party and instead go through an instantaneous sale and transfer process to deliver fiat to the merchant in real time.&#x20;

1\. User executes payment

2\. KEI API checks user balance

3\. API approves or rejects transaction

4\. At the same time, funds are moved from user to KEI wallet.&#x20;

5\. KEI wallet converts funds to fiat.&#x20;

6\. Fiat then goes to paying back the purchase.
