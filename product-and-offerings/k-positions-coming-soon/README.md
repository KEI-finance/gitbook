# K-Positions - Coming Soon

{% hint style="info" %}
Coming soon is the KEI StakeFrame Marketplace, a dedicated platform for the trade of staked positions represented as NFTs. While users presently have the ability to trade their NFTs on any public platform, this upcoming feature will streamline the process by allowing direct trading within the KEI ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

## **Introduction to K-Positions**

K-positions, a revolutionary product within the Kei Finance ecosystem, allows users to convert their staked positions into tradable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). K-positions encapsulate the full or partial value of a user's staked position, including the attached reward multipliers and APY, into a unique, tradable NFT.

## **Benefits of K-Positions**

* **For New Users:** k-positions provides an avenue for new participants to access established staking positions without committing to an upfront time lock. Users can purchase a K-positions NFT that is nearing its maturity, allowing them to enjoy the staking rewards sooner than initiating a new stake.
* **For Existing Users:** K-positions offers existing participants a mechanism to scale back or entirely exit their staking positions without incurring unstaking penalties. Instead of unstaking and enduring the associated costs, users can sell their staked position as a K-positions NFT, usually at a market value considerably higher than the penalty-adjusted unstaking value.

## **The K-Positions Process**

The K-positions process converts each stake into an ERC1155 NFT, differing from the common ERC20 standard. This approach brings several unique properties to the staked position:

* **Stake as an NFT:** Every stake created also generates a corresponding K-Positions NFT, representing the entire staking position.
* **Support for NFT Marketplaces:** K-Positions NFTs, being based on the ERC1155 standard, can be listed and traded on all compatible NFT marketplaces.
* **Total Supply and Transferability:** Each K-Positions NFT has a total supply and can be transferred in part or whole between accounts, offering enhanced flexibility in managing staking commitments.
* **Partial Unstaking:** Any account owning a portion of a K-positions NFT can unstake it at any time. This action withdraws a fraction of the total staked pool, enabling dynamic management of the staking position.
* **Stake Splitting:** your stake into multiple stakes, to either sell within the K-Positions marketplace, use within the protocol, or transfer to other wallets.

## Fees

By allowing the protocol to directly manage the transactions related to NFT marketplaces, we can avoid additional fees typically charged by those marketplaces. This enables us to redirect the fee amount back into the protocol itself, thereby contributing to the growth of the KEI token and providing rewards to token holders and stakers. This approach ensures that the protocol retains more value within its ecosystem, benefiting its participants and fostering further development and incentives for the community.
