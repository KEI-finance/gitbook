# KEI finance Marketplace - Future

Positioned as a crucial addition to our advanced trading ecosystem, Marketplace is designed to facilitate the unlocking and leveraging of the fractional intrinsic value of users' Positions and IDs. It is anticipated to bring about a sea change in the trading of electronic non-fungible tokens (e-NFTs), thereby fostering a vibrant, decentralized financial community.

## Introduction&#x20;

Our upcoming product, Marketplace, is envisioned to significantly reinforce KEI finance's mission to democratize finance and deliver tangible value to our community members. The platform is expected to increase the utility and tradability of Positions and IDs, thereby presenting potentially lucrative opportunities for active participants within our network.

### Anticipated Tradeability of IDs through Marketplace

Marketplace is being developed to empower users to maximize the value of their IDs. The projected tradable value of an ID will stem from two primary factors: affiliate quantity and name brevity. As affiliates expand their outreach, we anticipate the corresponding ID's value to increase. By building a robust network, affiliates could monetize their efforts by selling their ID for future potential earnings. This represents an exciting and potentially profitable opportunity for network builders.

### Future Fractional Trading of Positions on Marketplace

In addition to IDs, the Marketplace is also set to enhance the potential for Positions. Upon its launch, users will be able to trade their staked positions, either as a whole or in fractions. For example, if a user has $10,000 locked for 5 years, and after 2 years they decide to sell 50%, they will be able to offer half of their stake as a fractional eNFT on the marketplace via the Marketplace.



The Marketplace is being designed to incentivize purchases by offering appealing features related to Positions. Prospective buyers are projected to receive reward multipliers equivalent to a 5-year locked period, even though their position would only be locked for the remaining 3 years. This aspect is expected to make Position trading a lucrative opportunity, allowing users to optimize their investments.

## Conclusion

Marketplace, the anticipated addition to the KEI finance ecosystem, is expected to create a vibrant, decentralized financial community. By unlocking new avenues for value exchange and providing tangible incentives for active participation, the Marketplace is poised to revolutionize the DeFi industry and pave the way for a more inclusive and rewarding financial ecosystem.
