Using KEI finance payment cards, users can pay in store using the value of their crypto portfolio's that has previously been locked in wallet. User funds remain on the blockchain, maintaining user custody of assets, always. Using the payment system, users execute a payment in store and the value is sold off from their portfolio and converted to fiat to secure the transaction.&#x20;

### Asset Flow: A breakdown of how sales are executed&#x20;

> " Imagine never having to take your assets out of your wallet in order to spend them in the real world. "

With K-Pay we are able to provide the technology to allow users to spend directly from their user wallet.

This process will look as follows:

1. Approve your card to spend directly from your wallets / portfolios. This can be achieved by setting a daily, weekly, monthly spending limit on your card to prevent any kind of abuse or security issues.&#x20;
2. Use your card in the real world. This will then trigger a flow of actions as follows
   * User: Initiates a purchase using the KEI finance card at a merchant.
   * Merchant: Sends the payment request to the Provider.
   * Provider: Forwards the transaction details to KEI finance.
   * KEI finance: Validates the transaction by checking the user's wallet or portfolio position value and spending allowance.
   * KEI finance: Converts the assets into the appropriate currency to be spent.
   * Transaction Approval: Once funds are converted, KEI finance approves the transaction.

ProviderClearing and Settlement: Completes the transaction.The purchase details are sent back to KEI finance for clearing and then settled through Gelato Relay.

### Built for user custody: Your assets remain on-chain

One thing that is most important at KEI finance, is being able to retain the power of decentralisation. As more and more technology is built in crypto, we are seeing a move away from decentralisation. With KEI we are striving to keep everything on the blockchain and in the hands of the user. Why should the funds be transferred to a centralised entity?&#x20;
