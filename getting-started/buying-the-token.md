# Buying / Selling

Once users have successfully connected their wallets they can immediately engage in the buying process. To purchase Kei tokens, users need to have some funds in their wallets to exchange these assets for Kei tokens via a process otherwise known as 'Swapping’.

Unlike conventional DeFi platforms, the ‘Supplier contract’ on Kei Finance is designed such that when users try to swap their ETH for Kei tokens, the supplying happens inside the tokens from the ‘Swap.’ that, when a user initiates a ‘Swap’ order on Kei Protocol the router automatically executes a ‘Bond’ and a ’Swap,’ behind the scenes, in the best way that is for the user.

For instance, following a purchase order, should the purchase price specified by the user be cheaper than the ‘Swap’ price, the platform intuitively selects the ‘Bond’ price to buy from and vice versa - doing all of that in one transaction.

Currently, on Kei Finance, users can exchange their Ethereum tokens for Kei at a discount rate by purchasing Kei directly from their dashboard.

See the below walkthrough for detailed information on how to swap.

* Enter the amount of Ethereum you would like to trade for some Kei tokens based on the balance on your wallet account, and hit the ‘Confirm Swap’ button.

* Tap ‘Confirm’ once prompted by Metamask (or your non-custodial wallet of choice).

* On Kei Finance there is an option for users to automatically stake when they buy the Kei token through the process of ‘Swapping.’ Through this minimalistic approach users on Kei Protocol can ‘Buy’ these tokens and ‘Stake’ them in a single transaction, while also save some extra in transaction fees and having to go through the back and forth to ‘Buy’ and then do another transaction to ‘Stake,’ thereby reducing redundancy.

* Upon logging into their dashboard, while placing a ‘Buy’ order, users can choose to toggle the ‘Automatic Stake’ button on, to stake while buying, in one go.
