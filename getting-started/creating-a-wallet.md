# Connecting

To get started on the Kei Protocol users would have to visit the website and sign into their dashboard by connecting their non-custodial wallet of choice - in this case, we use Metamask just as seen in the steps below.

* Visit the website at [https://kei.fi](https://kei.fi), and click the ‘Dashboard’ button to sign into your Dashboard.
