# ðŸ’± K-DiversiFI: Decentralised Automated Investment Platform - Coming Soon

<mark style="background-color:green;">This needs input and more work - Kevin are you able to flesh this out?</mark>

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction to K-Trade</mark>&#x20;

K-Investis designed to allow users to further diversify their portfolio without the need to day trade by themselves. Acting as a decentralized index, K-Invest allows users to deposit their KEI tokens into the K-Invest pool and receive a portion of the rofits accrued from the algorithmic trading of a range of blue-chip tokens.



### <mark style="color:purple;">Decentralised Trading Smart Contracts</mark>&#x20;

K-Invest is governed by a smart contract,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The smart contract only has permissions to execute on trading the bluechip assets set to the contract. It cannot manage user funds and does not control user funds in anyway within the contract. Therefore K-trade users can withdraw their tokens at anytime providing a further security and control of their KEI tokens.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:green;">I think we re-word this. Kepp it high level. This section should be describing what K-invest is, what we invision for the future and benefits to users & platform.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Example:**</mark> User deposits 1000 KEI into the K-invest pool. The smart contract executes trading requests using KEI in the pool. The user can withdraw their KEI at anytime and profits distributed in the time their tokens were in the pool.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:purple;">KEI Profit Distribution</mark>&#x20;

Upon KEI deposit into the trading pool, KEI tokens will be distributed across all tradable assets governed by a % ratio. \
The user is allocated a % share of the pool based on how much they deposited. \
\
Upon exit of KEI from the pool the % share of each asset allocated to the user is converted back to KEI as profit and accessible to the user. \
\
<mark style="color:purple;background-color:green;">**Formula:**</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:purple;">Tradable Assets</mark>

Initially their will be 4 tradable assets via K-invest, BTC, ETH, DAI & KEI. As an initial index K-invest will focus on leading tokens before looking to further diversify into a range of decentralised indexes across the industry.
