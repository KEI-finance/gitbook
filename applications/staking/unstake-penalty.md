# Unstake Penalty

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to understand the penalties associated with unstacking before the designated stake end date. This is to ensure that you do not have any unexpected losses.
{% endhint %}

The Kei Finance staking protocol applies a penalty for unstaking tokens before the completion of the designated stake duration. This penalty functions on a progressive scale, only kicking in when stakers have served less than half of their stake duration.

In such cases, the penalty begins by reducing the accrued profits. The principal - or the original number of tokens staked - is only impacted once all the profits have been absorbed by the penalty. This essentially means that the penalty proportionately deducts from the current number of tokens the user has in stake, based on the duration at which they unstake.

This unstake penalty system encourages stakers to hold onto their tokens and maintain their stake for the entire duration. Its implementation is not purely punitive; it provides a system of redistribution that benefits long-term stakers. Any penalty tokens deducted from the unstake amount are redirected back into the staking pool, serving as additional rewards. This creates a beneficial cycle for those who choose to stake for extended durations and maintain their hold.
