# Unstake Penalty

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to understand the penalties associated with unstacking before the designated stake end date. This is to ensure that you do not have any unexpected losses.
{% endhint %}

The Kei Finance staking penalty is such that should a staker have served less than half their stake duration, only then will these penalties start to eat into the profits accrued and only eat into the principle when the profit have all been drained. Essentially eating into the current amount of tokens the user has in the stake, as a percentage based on the duration at which they unstake. &#x20;

The unstake penalty is applied when you are unstaking your tokens before the designated Stake Duration. It applies to both the principal and the rewards earned and is in place to incentivize people to hold their tokens and continue to stake for longer durations.

All penalty tokens that are subtracted from the unstake amount, are then returned into the staking pool directly as rewards. So this creates a feedback cycle for those that decide to stake for long durations and hold.
