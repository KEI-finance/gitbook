# ðŸ’¹ StakeFrame: KEI Staked NFT Trading

{% hint style="info" %}
Coming soon is the KEI StakeFrame Marketplace, a dedicated platform for the trade of staked positions represented as NFTs. While users presently have the ability to trade their NFTs on any public platform, this upcoming feature will streamline the process by allowing direct trading within the KEI ecosystem.

## **Introduction to StakeFrame**

StakeFrame, a revolutionary product within the Kei Finance ecosystem, allows users to convert their staked positions into tradable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). StakeFrame encapsulates the full or partial value of a user's staked position, including the attached reward multipliers and APY, into a unique, tradable NFT.

_**KEI StakeFrame Marketplace - coming soon** Users can currently trade their NFTs on any public NFT platform, and in the future they can trade directly on KEI._

### **Benefits of StakeFrame**

* **For New Users:** StakeFrame provides an avenue for new participants to access established staking positions without committing to an upfront time lock. Users can purchase a StakeFrame NFT that is nearing its maturity, allowing them to enjoy the staking rewards sooner than initiating a new stake.
* **For Existing Users:** StakeFrame offers existing participants a mechanism to scale back or entirely exit their staking positions without incurring unstaking penalties. Instead of unstaking and enduring the associated costs, users can sell their staked position as a StakeFrame NFT, usually at a market value considerably higher than the penalty-adjusted unstaking value.

### **The StakeFrame Process**

The StakeFrame process converts each stake into an ERC1155 NFT, differing from the common ERC20 standard. This approach brings several unique properties to the staked position:

* **Stake as an NFT:** Every stake created also generates a corresponding StakeFrame NFT, representing the entire staking position.
* **Support for NFT Marketplaces:** StakeFrame NFTs, being based on the ERC1155 standard, can be listed and traded on all compatible NFT marketplaces.
* **Total Supply and Transferability:** Each StakeFrame NFT has a total supply and can be transferred in part or whole between accounts, offering enhanced flexibility in managing staking commitments.
* **Partial Unstaking:** Any account owning a portion of a StakeFrame NFT can unstake it at any time. This action withdraws a fraction of the total staked pool, enabling dynamic management of the staking position.
