# ðŸ—£ K-Domain: Unique identify and referral

{% hint style="info" %}
The Identity contract is embedded entirely within the protocol. So whenever affiliate rewards are distributed, a percentage of rewards are allocated to the affiliate contract. This is applyied to all applications within the protocol.

## <mark style="color:purple;">**Introduction to Kei Finance Identity**</mark>

The Kei Finance Identity Program is an integral part of the KEI ecosystem, establishing an engaging relationship between users and the platform. It is powered by a dedicated Identity Contract, which is closely intertwined with the Rewards Contract. This connection ensures that a portion of every reward is directed to the Identity Contract, nurturing an all-inclusive rewards distribution process.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Becoming an Identity**</mark>

To become an identity, KEI community members need to secure a unique Kei Finance domain name, symbolized by an identity token. This token interacts with the reward contracts, facilitating reward distribution to identities. Community members can purchase these identity tokens using KEI tokens.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Pricing Model**</mark>

The cost of domain names is determined by two factors: the length of the domain name and the duration of ownership. Shorter names imply a higher cost, reflecting the premium nature of concise, memorable names. Additionally, the length of ownership acts as a price multiplier, where each extra year of ownership multiplies the base cost.

For instance, a domain name 'User.kei' with a base price of $100 secured for 3 years would cost 3 x Base Price, totaling to $300 in this case.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Identity Reward Structure**</mark>

The reward structure is hierarchical, where Level X is identified by Level (X+1). This structured reward distribution guarantees a scalable and sustainable growth model, encouraging the continuous participation of both new and existing users.

### <mark style="color:purple;">**How It Works**</mark>&#x20;

The unique feature of our identity system is the use of identity tokens, each representing a domain name. This system generates a unique user identity (UUID) linked with its corresponding identity token. When a new user, identified by an existing user's UUID, interacts with the platform and initiates their first transaction, it triggers the reward mechanism.

From this point forward, every action taken by the new user results in reward distribution to the identity holder or identifier. The wallet address of the identified user becomes permanently linked with the unique identity of the identifier, providing a continuous rewards stream.

### **Domain Name Trading**

Unique Kei Finance domain names, embodied as identity tokens, can be traded among users. These tokens, being NFTs, abide by the same rules as all other NFTs on the Kei Protocol. Each trade sparks the reward contract, triggering a distribution of fees as rewards to all protocol stakers, boosting the overall tokenomics of the KEI ecosystem.\
