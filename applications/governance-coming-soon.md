# ü§ù K-Gov: Governance - Coming Soon

At the heart of KEI's decentralized financial ecosystem is K-Governance, our automated governance model that promotes active community participation and fosters protocol growth in a democratic manner.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the Kei Protocol, staking is the only way to receive votes. The amount and duration of your stake directly impact the number of votes you possess. Larger and longer stakes result in more votes.
{% endhint %}

## Mechanism of K-Governance

Through on-chain governance, a key tenet of DeFi, KEI community members are empowered to influence the protocol's strategic direction. Governance token holders vote on a variety of protocol improvement decisions. This extends to matters such as the execution of intermittent smart contract audits, implementation of upgrades, exploration of third-party integrations, adjustments of protocol parameters, allocation of grants, and management of the treasury.

## Role of Staked KEI

Central to this governance model is the staking of KEI tokens. Users who stake their KEI receive staked-KEI (sKEI), which acts as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) token. This tokenization enables the distribution of voting rights and privileges to stakeholders. The accumulation of votes is proportional to the duration of KEI staking, hence incentivizing long-term participation in the ecosystem.

## The OpenZeppelin Framework

KEI's on-chain governance model is structured around the renowned open-source smart contract development framework, OpenZeppelin. Renowned for its robustness and security, the OpenZeppelin framework provides the perfect foundation for our evolving governance system.

## Future Developments in Governance

KEI is constantly refining and expanding its governance model, committed to increasing user empowerment and decentralization within the protocol. As we progress, expect more exciting updates to our K-Governance model, tailored to foster active community involvement and ensure the growth and evolution of the KEI Protocol are in the hands of those who matter most - our users.

K-Governance is a testament to KEI's commitment to promoting a democratic, decentralized, and transparent ecosystem, where every voice matters, and every stakeholder has a say in the protocol's future.
