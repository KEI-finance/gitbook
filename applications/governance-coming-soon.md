# ü§ù Governance - Coming Soon

Automated governance is a key component of decentralized finance also known as on-chain governance. Through the use of token-powered governance, protocol improvement decisions are voted on by governance token holders.

In the Kei Protocol, it is exactly the same. Such decisions like running intermittent smart contract audits and upgrades, third-party integrations, parameter modifications, grants, and treasury management are to be handled by these elite groups of users over time.

Users can create and vote on governance proposals by staking Kei to get staked-Kei. The staked Kei is the Decentralized Autonomous Organization - DAO - token that distributes these rights and privileges to stakeholders in the form of voting powers. This means the longer you stake your Kei tokens, the more staked Kei you get; therefore, the more votes you accumulate.

Kei Protocol employs the on-chain governance mechanism, as seen in the open-source smart contract development framework - [OpenZeppellin](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1671701120364707\&usg=AOvVaw1JvdrJ9qAuke5H\_pBWpfVs).
