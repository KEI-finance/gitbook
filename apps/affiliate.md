# ðŸ—£ Affiliate

{% hint style="info" %}
The affiliate contract is embedded entirely within the protocol. So whenever rewards a distributed, a percentage of rewards, are allocated to the affiliate contract. Applying to all applications within the protocol.
{% endhint %}

### How does it work?

The affiliate contract is a `Rewardable` contract, which integrates into the [Rewards](../technicals/kei-contracts/rewards.md) contract, meaning that on every reward received, a share is distributed to the **Affiliate** contract.

> **70%** of [Admin](../technicals/kei-contracts/admin.md) rewards are distributed to affiliates
>
> Unclaimed affiliate rewards are returned to the admin distribution

#### Distribution Table:

_Where `Level X` was referred by `Level (X+1)`_

| Level | Reward |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1     | 80%    |
| 2     | 10%    |
| 3     | 10%    |
