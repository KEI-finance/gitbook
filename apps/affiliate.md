# ðŸ—£ Affiliate

{% hint style="info" %}
The affiliate contract is embedded entirely within the protocol. So whenever affiliate rewards are distributed, a percentage of rewards are allocated to the affiliate contract. This is applyied to all applications within the protocol.
{% endhint %}

### How does it work?

The affiliate contract is a `Rewardable` contract, which is integrated into the [Rewards](../technicals/kei-contracts/rewards.md) contract. Therefore, on every reward received, a percentage share is distributed to the **Affiliate** contract.

Each domain name is represented as  an identity token that generates a unique user link connected to the identity token. \
\
When a new user comes to the website the conversion is recorded against your identity token and rewards are triggered when the user makes their first transaction on the protocol. \
\
When the user makes the transaction their wallet address is assigned to the unique identity of the referrer. This assignment is permanent meaning each action taken by the referee will distribute rewards back to the referrer.&#x20;

#### Distribution Table:

_Where `Level X` was referred by `Level (X+1)`_

| Level | Reward |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1     | 80%    |
| 2     | 10%    |
| 3     | 10%    |

### How to become an Affiliate. &#x20;

Kei Finance community members can become Affiliates by purchasing a unique Kei Finance domain name. The domain name is represented by an Identity token. The Identity token is what interacts with the reward contracts to distribute rewards back to Affiliates. Community can purchase identity tokens using KEI tokens.&#x20;

### Pricing model for unique Kei Finance domain names

Domain name costs are dependant upon two factors. The number of characters in a domain name are the first price factor. The less characters used the higher the cost of the domain name.&#x20;

Secondly, domain names are purchased with a duration range. Each year purchased will act as a price multiplier. \
\
**Example:** 'User.kei' has a base price = $100 \
To buy for 3 years would cost 3 x Base Price. The total price in this example is $300&#x20;

### Trading Domain Names&#x20;

Unique Kei Finance domain names are represented as identity tokens. An identity token is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). The same rules apply to all NFTs for the Kei protocol. NFTs on the Kei Protocol can be traded between users. Every trade triggers the reward contract to distribute fees as rewards to all protocol stakers.\
