# ðŸ’¹ NFT Stake Trading

### NFT Staked Positions&#x20;

Positions staked into the Kei Finance protocol can be integrated into NFTs. Users have the ability to segment their staked positions and represent a portion of their staked positions. The NFT then represents the full or proportion of a users stake including the reward multipliers and APY.&#x20;

**Benefits**&#x20;

**New Users:** Users who wish to enter positions without the upfront time lock commitment can purchase an NFT stake position that has little time allowing access to rewards sooner.

**Existing Users:**  Users wishing to scale back their positions or exit the protocol altogether can sell their position as an NFT which avoids the unstaking penalties. The stake is sold based on the current market value of that position which is generally significantly higher than unstaking your position with incurred penalties.&#x20;
