# ðŸŒ± Staking

{% hint style="info" %}
The staking contract will be a core way to grow your investment over a long period of time. A percentage of all rewards the protocol earns, goes straight into the hands of the Stakers.
{% endhint %}

#### Technical Specification

* [Staking](../../technicals/kei-contracts/staking.md)
* [% Rewards](../../mechanics/rewards.md)&#x20;

## How does it work?

The staking mechanic in KEI finance rewards long term holders, by giving a greater return on rewards, for the longer duration that you stake. This is determined by the [Reward Multiplier](./#undefined).

On top off this, there is also a punishment for those looking to withdraw their stake partially or entirely before the end of the staking duration. This is known as the [Unstake Fee](./#paper-hands-fee).

### Reward Multiplier

It is important to understand the benefit and consequences of specifying how long your want to stake your tokens for.  In this section we discuss the **Reward Multiplier** which represents a multiplier, applied to the tokens you stake, in essence, giving you a greater stake than originally put in.
