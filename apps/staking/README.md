## How does it work?

There are two main arguments associated with staking.

| Argument       | Description                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Stake Duration | How long you would like to stake for    |
| Stake Amount   | How many tokens you would like to stake |

It is important to understand the benefits and consequences associated with your _Stake Duration_ to avoid risks and maximize returns. When it comes to the _Stake Duration_ there are two main factors at play that need to be thought about.

### Reward Multiplier

Rewards long term holders, by giving a greater return on rewards for the longer duration that you stake. [Read More](reward-multiplier.md)

### Unstake Penalty

The penalty is associated with fully/partially exitting a stake earlier than specified. This penalty is subtracted from your equivalent stake amount and then redistributed to all stakers. [Read More](unstake-penalty.md)
