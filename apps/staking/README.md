# ðŸŒ± Staking

{% hint style="info" %}
The staking contract will be a core way for users to grow their investment over a long period of time by earning long-term rewards and high yields on their staked investments. Staked Kei tokens are used to secure, grow, ensure and re-assure the protocolâ€™s continuous operability. On Kei, the longer you stake, the better reward you get - it's that simple!
{% endhint %}

A percentage of all rewards earned on the platform are reallocated and go straight into the hands of the Stakers.

To deter users from entering and exiting the pool at will, thereby affecting the tokenâ€™s utility in real-time, the staking protocol on Kei finance utilises a slashing penalty to disincentivize them from doing so, hence, demanding stakers to be more responsible.

On Kei Finance, users can stake their Kei tokens to enter a stake position for a stipulated period to get staked-Kei. Once staked, holders of these staked-Kei tokens will not be able to retract or unstake their tokens before the designated stake duration is up, without incurring a penalty.

Holders of the staked-Kei tokens who intend to unstake their assets before the stipulated time frame would incur a penalty which is calculated as a fraction of the staked period to the predefined stake duration.

The longer the stake duration, the better rewards, and the bigger the potential penalty should a staker default.

For instance, should a user opt to stake their Kei tokens for a period of 365 days, and afterward decide to leave the pool before the pre-stipulated time of 365 days or one year, that staker would be charged a penalty such that should the user decide to opt-out within the first 10 days, they incur a much higher percentage of the penalty - say 99%. Whereas a staker who decides to unstake halfway through the year or opt-out towards their latter days of leaving the liquidity pool, say day 340, such a user would incur only a slight penalty, in comparison to the first instance.

Originally, these penalties are levied on the entire stake, starting off with the profits. So depending on how early users unstake, it will eat into their principal as well.

Nonetheless, stakers on Kei Finance are provided with the option to â€˜partially unstakeâ€™, and only incur a fee on the tokens that they choose to unstake at that point in time.

If after the stipulated stake duration the user has not opted out of the pool, they could leave their stake while having it continuously earn them rewards. At this point, they can choose to unstake it at any time without having to incur any penalties.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_After the stake duration is up, then there is no penalty to unstake, so the staker can unstake at any time_

More on the penalties associated with unstaking earlier than stipulated can be seen in the [Unstake Penalty](./#unstake-penalty) section.
