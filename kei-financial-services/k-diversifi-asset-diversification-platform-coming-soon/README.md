K-DiversiFi is a decentralized asset management platform that aims to offer individuals a secure and reliable method to grow their funds. It achieves this by utilizing K-DiversiFi pools, which are designed to represent various assets and strategies. These pools provide users with the flexibility to diversify their portfolio according to their preferences, while also incorporating risk management strategies.

The primary purpose of K-DiversiFi is to enable users to invest in a range of assets and strategies without having to manage them individually. By participating in different pools, users can gain exposure to various assets. Each pool is managed by a set of predefined strategies, which could involve different investment approaches, risk tolerance levels, or even specific sectors or themes.

By offering a decentralized platform, K-DiversiFi aims to provide transparency, security, and autonomy to its users. The decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has control over the funds or the decision-making process. Instead, the management of assets and strategies is governed by smart contracts and community consensus.

Additionally, K-DiversiFi focuses on risk management, recognizing that every investment carries a certain level of risk. By implementing risk management strategies within each pool, the platform aims to protect users' investments and mitigate potential losses. These risk management mechanisms could include diversification across assets, regular rebalancing, stop-loss orders, or other risk mitigation techniques.

## Base Asset

In K-DiversiFi, pools are structured around a specific base asset, with the goal of accumulating the highest amount of that asset. The pool's success and profitability are measured by the increase in holdings of the designated base asset. For example, if the base asset is Ethereum, profit is achieved when the pool accumulates more Ethereum. Likewise, if the base asset is USDC, profit is attained when the pool amasses more USDC. This base asset-focused structure ensures that the pool's performance aligns with the accumulation of the designated asset, enabling users to track and evaluate profitability based on their chosen base asset.

## Whitelisted Assets

In the K-DiversiFi platform, each pool is created by a trader who assumes the responsibility of managing the assets within that specific pool. When creating a pool, the trader will whitelist the assets that will be included in the pool. Once the pool is created and the assets are whitelisted, they cannot be edited or modified. This measure is implemented to prevent any malicious activities or unauthorized changes to the assets within the pool.

To participate in a pool, users can deposit their assets into the specific pool managed by the trader. However, it's important to note that the trader will only have trade-only permission for that particular pool. This means that the trader can execute trades and manage the assets within the pool but does not have full control over the deposited assets. The users' funds remain within the pool and are not accessible for direct withdrawal or any other unauthorized actions by the trader.

## Trader Fee

To incentivize traders and bot makers to utilize our platform, we offer a customizable fee structure determined during pool creation. Pool creators have the freedom to decide how much they wish to receive in return for their services. This fee is applied to the profit generated from trades. As a result, whenever a successful trade occurs, the pool creator receives a portion of the profit. To facilitate this, we provide a selection of predefined fee options, allowing pool creators to choose the fee structure that best aligns with their preferences and goals.

| Fees |
| ---- |
| 0.5% |
| 1%   |
| 2%   |
| 5%   |
| 10%  |
| 20%  |
| 50%  |

## Risk Management

K-DiversiFi introduces a risk management feature that empowers users to set take profit and stop loss thresholds for their investments. If the investment value falls below the stop loss point, it is securely placed in a safe zone, preventing additional trades. Similarly, when the take profit threshold is met, the assets are moved to the safe zone. Users maintain control over their assets in the safe zone, with the flexibility to withdraw or reactivate them within the pool. This user-centric approach enables individuals to actively manage their investments according to their preferences and adapt to market conditions.

## Protocol Redistribution

In order to support the protocol's maintenance and provide benefits to all K token holders, a fee proportional to the profit is also imposed. This fee is similar to the trader fee and is determined by the protocol itself. The profit allocated to the protocol follows the same distribution mechanisms as other avenues generating profit. This ensures that the profit shared with the protocol is subject to fair and equitable distribution among participants, contributing to the overall sustainability and growth of the ecosystem.

## Reward Multiplier

When participating in K-DiversiFi through the staking platform, users have the opportunity to leverage the benefit of a reward multiplier applied to their stake position. This means that the return on investment (ROI) received from the diversify pool is amplified based on the reward multiplier associated with the staking pool. By staking their assets, users can enjoy a greater incentive and higher potential rewards for actively participating in the ecosystem.

On the other hand, if users choose not to go through the staking platform (K-Stake), they will receive the default 1x multiplier for the assets placed into the K-DiversiFi pool. While still being able to participate in the diversify pool, the rewards will not be enhanced by the reward multiplier provided through staking.

The reward multiplier offered through the staking platform encourages users to stake their assets, thereby increasing their potential returns and providing greater incentives for active participation in the K-DiversiFi ecosystem.\


## How do users generate ROI

In K-DiversiFi, users generate ROI based on the performance of the selected trader responsible for the pool. Choosing a trusted and profitable trader is key. Profitable trades, where the trader buys and sells assets at a higher base asset value, contribute to the ROI. The pool operates with auto-compounding, reinvesting the profit back into the pool. This growth mechanism allows users to continuously benefit from the trader's successful trades and aims to maximize returns over time.

By utilizing the auto-compounding feature and selecting a reliable trader, K-DiversiFi creates a dynamic investment ecosystem. Users own shares of the pool and the reinvested profit fuels further trading opportunities by the trader. This approach enhances the potential for compounding returns and facilitates the continuous growth of the pool.
