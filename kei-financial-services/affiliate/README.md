# ðŸ—£ K-Domain: Unique identify and referral

{% hint style="info" %}
The Identity contract is embedded entirely within the protocol. So whenever affiliate rewards are distributed, a percentage of rewards are allocated to the affiliate contract. This is applied to all applications within the protocol.
{% endhint %}

## **Introduction to Kei Finance Identity**

The Kei Finance Identity Program is an integral part of the KEI ecosystem, establishing an engaging relationship between users and the platform. It is powered by a dedicated Identity Contract, which is closely intertwined with the Affiliate Contract. This connection ensures that a portion of all profits are directed to the users, nurturing an all-inclusive rewards distribution process.

## **Becoming an Affiliate - Purchasing an Identity**

To become an affiliate for the Kei Finance protocol, you need to register an identity, which will assign a unique URL to your wallet address. The registration process involves purchasing an identity directly from the Kei Finance website or an NFT marketplace. Each identity is registered for a specific duration and can be renewed or repurchased by others once it expires. As identities are represented as NFTs, they can be freely traded on any NFT marketplace, providing flexibility and potential value for participants.

### **Pricing Model**

The cost of domain names is determined by two factors: the length of the domain name and the duration of ownership. Shorter names imply a higher cost, reflecting the premium nature of concise, memorable names. Additionally, the length of ownership acts as a price multiplier, where each extra year of ownership multiplies the base cost.

> **Example**
>
> _A identity name 'SomeName' (8 characters) would have a base price of 100 tokens secured for 3 years would cost 3 x Base Price, totalling to 300 KEI tokens in this case._

## **How it works**

Once an identity NFT has been purchased, the owner will receive a unique URL that associates the identity with that URL. When someone visits the platform through this unique identity URL, that person is assigned to the owner of the corresponding identity NFT, as long as it still exists.

If the person has already been assigned to another owner, they will not be reassigned to a new owner.

In the case of a successful referral, the owner of the identity NFT will receive a Referral NFT to represent the referral of the new user. The owner of the referral NFT becomes eligible for referral rewards whenever the referred person generates profit through their activities on the platform.

By leveraging the ownership of the referral NFT, the platform incentivizes identity owners to actively refer new users to the platform, as they can earn referral rewards based on the profitability of the referred users' actions.

## **Affiliate Payout Structure**

\
The affiliate structure in Kei Finance follows a hierarchical system that aims to incentivize content creators, influencers, and users. This system operates based on a referral tree, where each tier receives a payout.

The payout structure prioritizes the first level, ensuring that those who directly bring new users on board receive the highest commission. This encourages and rewards the efforts of the initial promoters who contribute to the growth of the platform. Additionally, there is a second level in the affiliate structure, incentivizing individuals to bring on board other influencers and marketers. This creates a cascading effect, expanding the network and incentivizing multiple levels of referrals.

By implementing this hierarchical payout structure, Kei Finance provides a fair and comprehensive incentive program to content creators, influencers, and users. It encourages the recruitment of new users and the engagement of influencers, promoting the platform's growth through multiple levels of referrals.

## Identity Trading

Unique Kei Finance domain names, embodied as identity tokens, can be traded among users. These tokens, being NFTs, abide by the same rules as all other NFTs on the Kei Protocol. Each trade sparks the reward contract, triggering a distribution of fees as rewards to all protocol stakers, boosting the overall tokenomics of the KEI ecosystem.\
