# ðŸ”„ K-Swap: Advanced Swapping

{% hint style="info" %}
K-Swap operates on a Fixed Rate Price model, ensuring that users receive the most advantageous rate when making their purchases directly through our website.
{% endhint %}

The K-Swap features offer a seamless onboarding experience onto the Kei Protocol, enabling users to effortlessly stake and swap tokens in a single transaction. By combining these functionalities, it not only saves users on transaction fees but also facilitates a controlled supply flow within the protocol. This innovative mechanism ensures a gradual and stable increase in the token supply while maintaining efficient operations.

Where a K-Swap purchase transaction would look like the following:

## Supply Percentage: Rewarding Long Term Stakers&#x20;

K-Swap employs a strategic approach, offering to supplement a percentage of an individual's purchase contingent on their staking duration. This strategy is crafted to deliver higher discounts for more extended staking periods, thereby motivating users to stake longer and receive larger discounts.

The precise contribution from K-Swap is not random, but is carefully calculated. It depends on a specific formula that considers the length of staking among other factors. The formula is as follows:

| Variable |                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| x        | What percentage the will be supplied |
| P        | The maximum supply percentage        |
| p        | The minimum supply percentage        |
| S        | The maximum stake duration           |
| s        | The minimum stake duration           |
| t        | The users designated stake duration  |

| Maximum Stake Duration    | 3333 Days |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| Minimum Stake Duration    | 0 Days    |
| Maximum Supply Percentage | 80%       |
| Minimum Supply Percentage | 3%        |

## Fixed Rate Price: Competitive Token Prices

The Fixed Rate Price represents the established cost at which each token is sold during its distribution phase through the supplier. It provides a contrast to the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, where every subsequent token purchased incrementally escalates the token's price. To make this proposition more attractive, a special discount is applied to the fixed rate, designed to encourage purchases directly through our website, and to incentivize long-term token holdings.

Determining the specific fixed rate for a particular token is a straightforward process. It can be derived using the following formula:

<table><thead><tr><th width="192">Variable</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>x</td><td>The price of the of the fixed rate supplied tokens</td></tr><tr><td>d</td><td>The discount applied in percent (example: 0.2 for 20%)</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>The current price of the token in based on the supply</td></tr></tbody></table>

| Discount Rate | 20% |
| ------------- | --- |

## Distribution of Funds: Benefitting All Investors

When the supplier springs into action and new tokens are minted, the funds received from the purchase are divided into two key portions. The first segment directly supports each minted token, establishing its inherent value. The remainder of the funds is seen as profit.

The focus of these profit mechanics is twofold: fostering the protocol's growth and bolstering the liquidity pool. The expansion of the liquidity pool contributes to price stability, preventing sharp fluctuations and ensuring a smoother trading experience. Meanwhile, the protocol's growth adds value for all investors by raising the floor price and providing attractive staking rewards.

The following diagram provides a clear illustration of how the funds are initially distributed upon supply:

{% hint style="info" %}
This method allows the liquidity pool to expand autonomously through the protocol's automation, eliminating the need for manual user input.
{% endhint %}

## Transaction Fees: Fuelling the Protocol

Every transaction incurs a fee that fuels the protocol's growth, benefitting all investors within the protocol. The prevailing fee structure is as follows:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Amount</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Buying</td><td>0.6%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Selling</td><td>0.6%</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

When purchases are made directly through the website, the buy fee is effectively mitigated by the application of a discounted supply rate. This mechanism implies the potential for a fee-free purchase experience on the website, as the applied discount could entirely offset the buying fee.

## **Automated Buyback and Burn: Ensuring Price Stability**

If the KEI token price dips below the defined floor price during a transaction, the protocol instantaneously purchases the tokens back and initiates a burn process. This action reduces the total supply of KEI, which counteracts the price drop and restores the token's price back up to the floor level. This automated buyback-and-burn mechanism ensures the sustained stability of the KEI token price, minimizing the impact of market volatility on the Kei Finance ecosystem.

## **Affiliate Tracking: Rewarding Community Contribution**

K-Swap is not merely a tool for trade optimization; it also serves a crucial role in the Kei affiliate program. As each swap transaction is conducted, the SwapRouter records the transaction's affiliate, enabling the protocol to keep a meticulous record of affiliate contributions. This feature fosters a sense of community and shared profit, as it enables affiliates to receive deserved rewards for their contributions to the Kei Finance ecosystem.
