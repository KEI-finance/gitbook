# ðŸ’± K-Trade: Decentralised Automated Trading Platform - Coming Soon

<mark style="background-color:green;">This needs input and more work - Kevin are you able to flesh this out?</mark>

## Introduction to K-Trade&#x20;

K-trade is designed to allow users to further diversify their portfolio without the need to day trade by themselves. Acting as a decentralised index, K-trade allows users to deposit their KEI tokens into the K-Trade pool and receive a portion of the profits  accrued from the algorithmic trading of a range of bluechip tokens.



### Automated Trading Algorithms



### Decentralised Trading Smart Contracts&#x20;

K-trade is governed by a smart contract,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The smart contract only has permissions to execute on trading the bluechip assets set to the contract. It cannot manage user funds and does not control user funds in anyway within the contract. Therefore K-trade users can withdraw their tokens at anytime providing a further security and control of their KEI tokens.&#x20;

**Example:** User deposits 1000 KEI into the K-Trade pool. The smart contract executes trading requests using KEI in the pool. The user can withdraw their KEI at anytime and profits distributed in the time their tokens were in the pool.&#x20;

### KEI Profit Distribution&#x20;

Upon KEI deposit into the trading pool, KEI tokens will be distributed across all tradable assets governed by a % ratio. \
The user is allocated a % share of the pool based on how much they deposited. \
\
Upon exit of KEI from the pool the % share of each asset allocated to the user is converted back to KEI as profit and accessible to the user. \
\
**Formula:**&#x20;

### Tradable Assets

Initially their will be 4 tradable assets via K-Trade, BTC, ETH, DAI & KEI. As an initial index K-Trade will focus on leading bluechip tokens before looking to further diversify into a range of decentralised indexes across the industry.&#x20;
