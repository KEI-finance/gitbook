# Welcome to Kei Finance

Kei Finance aims to be a leader in how defi protocols operate and run. We are creating solutions for many of the pain points in the space, through alternative algorithms and transparent processes.

Striving to provide accurate APY's, stable backings and a real return on your investment.

## Core Mechanics

The following discusses the core mechanics behind the protocol, striving to provide safe and effective long term investment for all involved.

### Backed Tokens

There is no such thing as minting out of thin air in Kei. Every token is created with value giving a true value to the APY, and making sure those rewards you earn, do not go down in value.

### Raising Floor Price

The automatically increasing floor price backing each token in the protocol. Preventing the token price from ever going below the floor price.

### Ceiling Price

Being a certain distance away from the floor, the Ceiling Price is able to keep the price between two points, increasing price stability, and decreasing fluctuations.

### Fees

The token has a fee whitelist. Meaning that address added, will subtract a fee from the each transaction, and allocate it back into the reward system.
