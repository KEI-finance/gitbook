# Overview

The KEI finance protocol and these docs are bound to the following[ terms and conditions.](https://kei.fi/terms)

KEI finance is built from the lessons we have learnt in DeFi. Traditionally DeFi remains to be inaccessible to the average trader, especially when it comes to complicated cross-chain yield bearing positions. Alongside complexity, DeFi lacks any real world connection, where digital assets remain on the blockchain and without direct value linked to real world use cases. KEI finance has rebuilt DeFi to be as accessible as any web2 trading platform and is linked with KEI finance debit cards that offer direct blockchain to vendor payments, connecting your crypto and yield to real life payments without 3rd party user fund management.&#x20;

KEI finance operates on 3 founding principles **Access | Grow | Transact.**&#x20;

## Our Mission

KEI finance's mission is simple. Deliver a decentralised asset management platform that feels like any other traditional e-commerce trading website. It is within our mission to remove the complexities of DeFi and create a new era of access that is supported by automated asset growth mechanics and tangible real world utility. At KEI finance the user need not know they are even interacting with the blockchain, as the UI/UX is built in ways that trigger intuitive user flows driving conversions of traditional traders.&#x20;

Our platform is engineered to provide an array of financial tools and user experiences, that meet the requirements of **Access | Grow | Transact**. These include:

* [Cross-Chain & Fiat Backed Token Swaps](product-and-offerings/swapping/)
* [Familiar Login Methods ](welcome-to-kei-finance/getting-started/)
* [KEI Token Staking](technicals/kei-contracts/staking.md)
* [On-Chain Affiliate Systems ](technicals/kei-contracts/affiliate.md)
* [Automated Trading Strategies](product-and-offerings/kei-automated-trading-strategies.md)
* [KEI Debit Card Payments - Direct Blockchain to vendor payments](product-and-offerings/kei-debit-card-payments.md)

By combining the concept of **Access | Grow | Transact** into one ecosystem KEI finance delivers a decentralised financial growth platform that anyone can use. The result being a comprehensive experience from point of entry and then a seamless exit via real world spending.&#x20;

## **Our Vision**

Keep it simple. Kevin the founder of KEI finance conceptualised the protocol off the idea that a user need not know they are even interacting with the blockchain when growing their digital asset portfolio. It was with this thought that KEI was born. We have built a protocol that mirrors common Web2 themes driving an intuitive experience where non crypto users can easily self-guide through the platform and begin accumulating and transacting in digital assets.&#x20;

## Our Value Proposition

### **Simplified and Intuitive DeFi Access**&#x20;

KEI finance offers a range of login options that reflect the stage of an individuals user journey. Connect with KEI via common Web2 logins including email and social accounts or opt for Web3 native connections such as direct wallet connect or anonymous options.\
\
Investing in DeFi shouldn't be a complex and manual task. KEI has built a seamless 4 step automated investment flow that reflects traditional investment UI/UX. Enter algorithmic trading strategies by simply selecting the tokens you wish to accumulate, inputting your investment value, selecting a custom trade duration and profit or loss triggers. KEI will automatically distribute your investment across relative strategies to begin growing your portfolio based on your 4 step input.&#x20;

### **Autonomous Portfolio Growth**&#x20;

Traditionally, trading in DeFi has required immense manual inputs from a user across multiple projects and protocols. KEI finance automates asset growth by providing the user with a range of trading strategies. After initial investment, the KEI finance protocol will diversify user funds across strategies and begin automatically accruing desired assets. \
\
Users have the option to completely customise their experience by using a combination of all or no protocol strategies, and creating their own trading systems. No matter your style of trading, set the inputs and let KEI finance begin growing your assets via our self-automated technology.&#x20;

### **Direct Blockchain to Vendor Payment Solutions**

In a Blockchain first, KEI finance users can connect KEI debit cards directly to active trading positions and their crypto wallets. Without needing to have funds managed by third parties, users can make payments using the value in trading positions or their wallet in any shop across the globe. KEI debit cards work just like any other Mastercard and can be used for online purchases, subscriptions, cash out or direct in-shop buying. \

### User Reward Distribution & Growth

We've architected a unique reward mechanism that channels the platform's profits back to the token holders. The platform itself serves as a multi-faceted tool for profit distribution, contributing to the users' share of profits while bolstering the growth of the KEI ecosystem.

### **Security, Transparency, and Growth**

KEI finance builds upon a foundation of robust security and transparency. With our KEI contract open for public analysis, we express our commitment to maintaining a clear and trustworthy environment. As the funds under KEI's management increase, the platform becomes progressively more attractive to token holders.

Together, these aspects form the cornerstone of KeI finance's value proposition. By offering a set of sophisticated financial tools, we strive to create a user-centric, automated DeFi platform that revolutionises the traditional financial landscape.
