# Welcome to Kei Finance

KEI Finance is about more than just quick gains – it's about long-term growth, quality technology, and creating real change in the DeFi sector. We're committed to addressing the industry's pain points and restoring trust.&#x20;

Our mission is to redefine your DeFi experience, providing a comprehensive platform that blends cutting-edge technology with user-centric financial services to provide a fully automatic, self-governing ecosystem. KEI is designed to pave the way for an entirely new DeFi landscape – one where the tokenomics are in favour of the Hodlers.&#x20;

By ensuring a hard floor price that continually increases over time, we aim to negate any negative impacts and build a system that provides consistent growth and value.&#x20;

At KEI Finance, we've designed innovative reward distribution mechanisms that funnel profits back to our users. Our system ensures that as KEI Finance grows, so does your share of the profits.&#x20;

KEI's unique financial structuring is designed to increase the current supply while providing substantial benefits to invested stakeholders.&#x20;

The protocol we employ is unlike any other, avoiding the dilution of token value prevalent in many systems. How? Our innovative token supply mechanism sees every token purchase's entire cost go to the protocol, directly benefiting our users by increasing floor prices, liquidity pool sizes, or staking rewards, thus ensuring a level of price security for our token holders.&#x20;

This makes KEI Finance a remarkably lucrative platform for token holders, as the protocol's fund control grows significantly with each token supply.&#x20;

Our advanced architecture offers robust security and transparency, with our KEI contract visible for public scrutiny.&#x20;

Furthermore, we are continuously working on integrating new features, like a decentralized asset management and borrowing platform, to offer you a comprehensive DeFi experience. Join KEI Finance today and explore a smarter, more rewarding world of decentralized finance. Welcome to the future.

## Tokenomics

### Fees

KEI Finance has implemented a strategic fee structure designed to foster sustainable growth and reward protocol participants. Our fixed transaction fee of 0.3%, applied to every buy or sell operation, not only drives platform longevity but is also redistributed across stakers, the treasury, affiliates, and administrative channels, thereby promoting a balanced, incentivized ecosystem.
