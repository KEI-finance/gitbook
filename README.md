# Welcome to Kei Finance

Kei Finance aims to be the light for how defi protocols should operate and run. We are creating solutions for many of the pain points in the space, through alternative algorithmic operations and transparent processes.

Striving to provide accurate APY's, stable backings and a real return on your investment.

## Core Mechanics

The following discusses the core mechanics behind the protocol, striving to provide safe and effective long term investment for all involved.

### Backed Tokens

There is no such thing as minting out of thin air in Kei. Every token is created with value giving a true value to the APY, and making sure those rewards you earn, do not go down in value.

### Raising Floor Price

The automatically increasing floor price backing each token in the protocol. Preventing the token price from ever going below the floor price.

### Ceiling Price

Being a certain distance away from the floor, the Ceiling Price is able to keep the price between two points, increasing price stability, and decreasing fluctuations.

### Fees

The token is able to apply a fee whitelist, to certain addresses, allowing for rewards to be directly taken from each transaction that happens to and from this address

**Good to know:** Splitting your product into fundamental concepts, objects, or areas can be a great way to let readers deep dive into the concepts that matter most to them. Combine guides with this approach to 'fundamentals' and you're well on your way to great documentation!
