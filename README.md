# Welcome to Kei Finance

Kei Finance is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application that solves many of the pain points associated with traditional financial products and services. With advanced algorithms and transparent processes, Kei Finance offers a high return on investment and attractive interfaces that make it easy to use and understand.

## Core Mechanics

The following discusses the core mechanics behind the protocol, striving to provide safe and effective long term investment for all involved.

### Backed Tokens

There is no such thing as minting out of thin air in Kei. Every token is created with value giving a true value to the APY, and making sure those rewards you earn, do not go down in value.

### Raising Floor Price

The automatically increasing floor price backing each token in the protocol. Preventing the token price from ever going below the floor price.

### Ceiling Price

Being a certain distance away from the floor, the Ceiling Price is able to keep the price between two points, increasing price stability, and decreasing fluctuations.

### Fees

The token has a fee whitelist. Meaning that address added, will subtract a fee from the each transaction, and allocate it back into the reward system.
