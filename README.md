# Welcome to Kei Finance

Decentralized finance Protocols are evolving swiftly, given the proliferation of blockchain-powered crypto-backed investment protocols and instruments. New iterations to traditional finance instruments and market situations are already arising as seamless substitutes to traditional finance status quos.

Kei Finance is a Decentralized Finance - DeFi - application that solves many of the pain points associated with traditional financial products and services. With advanced algorithms and transparent processes, Kei Finance offers a high return on investment fused with enticing reward packages wrapped up in an easy-to-use interface.&#x20;

Overall the Kei Finance Protocol entails some key functionalities common to modern-day Automated Market Makers, such as a Swapping & Bonding protocol,  Staking and Lending functionalities, and treasury management.

## Core Mechanics

The following discusses the core mechanics behind the protocol, striving to provide safe and effective long-term investment for all involved.

### Backed Tokens

There is no such thing as minting out of thin air in Kei. Every token is created to accrue more collective value for every staker, by way of the Annual Percentage Yield - APY - while ensuring rewards users earn do not diminish over time.

Four reward distributions reallocate profits to users in multiple tiers on Kei Protocol. This includes the Staker's reward, Treasury Reward, Debt Reward and Affiliate reward. Through these reward programs, the platform maintains a system that reallocates revenue, such as those generated from penalties and fees on the platform, back to the reward pool and trickles down to stakeholders on the platform; such as Stakers whose funds power the liquidity pool.

### &#x20;Reward System

Kei's reward system is what makes the protocol next level. Through fully autonomous blockchain based rewards, the reward system allows the protocol to be fully backed by the people.

### Raising Floor Price

The automatically increasing floor price backing each token in the protocol. Preventing the token price from ever going below the floor price.

### Fees

The token has a fee whitelist. Meaning that address added, will subtract a fee from the each transaction, and allocate it back into the reward system.
